Abigail,4,"Oh, hi."
Abigail,Introduction,"Oh, that's right... I heard someone new was moving onto that old farm.# #It's kind of a shame, really. I always enjoyed exploring those overgrown fields by myself. "
Abigail,Resort_Entering,I hope a mermaid visits the beach.
Abigail,Resort_Leaving,I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back.
Abigail,Resort_Leaving_2,Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back.
Abigail,Resort_Shore,"The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!"
Abigail,Resort_Shore_2,"Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island?# #Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways. "
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella,My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while.# #I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy.
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella_2,"Hey @, want to build a sand castle with me?# #Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler! "
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella_3,"Hey @, you think you could build a raft?# #I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit."
Abigail,Resort_Wander,"An island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure.# #Quick, get me a shovel!# #Relax, I'm just kidding. "
Abigail,Resort_Bar,"Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great! "
Abigail,Resort,Bummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach... # #And I brought my sword and everything... 
Abigail,danceRejection,That's flattering... but I'm gonna have to say no. Sorry.
Abigail,divorced,What are you doing here? Just leave me alone! 
Abigail,dumped_Girls,Don't talk to me! 
Abigail,secondChance_Girls," ... I can't stay mad at you anymore, @. Let's just move on with our lives. "
Abigail,breakUp,Oh... I... I understand. You see me as just a friend... # #I guess we weren't really a good match... 
Abigail,Mon,"Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?"
Abigail,Mon2,"Oh, hi!# #Do you ever hang out at the cemetery? It's a peaceful place to spend some time alone."
Abigail,Tue,Ugh... I'm not in a good mood right now. # #I said I'm not in a good mood... what do you want? 
Abigail,Tue2,"... ... # #I know my parents mean well, but sometimes they just cannot understand my point of view. Weren't they ever young?"
Abigail,Wed,Hey. Sorry in advance if I say anything rude. I didn't get much sleep last night.# #What do you want?
Abigail,Thu,"# Abigail1#Oh no, I think my Dad's going to cook dinner tonight... # #I don't feel like doing anything today... "
Abigail,Fri,"Wow, I just realized it's Friday. # #Sometimes I totally lose track of time."
Abigail,Fri2,"We're all going to hang out in the saloon this evening. It's kind of like a friday tradition, I guess."
Abigail,Sat,The fresh mountain air is nice on a day like this. # #I wonder if the frogs will make an appearance soon.
Abigail,Sun,Oh man... I've been pushing off my homework all weekend. Looks like I'll be pulling another all-nighter... 
Abigail,Sun2,"I wonder what would happen if I spent all night in the graveyard?# Sun_old#@, What do you think happens to us after we die?# 17 0 Sun_17#I have no idea.# 18 40 Sun_18#We come back as spooky ghosts.# 17 0 Sun_17#We go to Heaven.# 18 0 Sun_17#Our energy bodies enter the astral plane.# 17 30 Sun_nothing#Nothing. We just cease to exist."
Abigail,Sun_old," 17#I guess you think nothing would happen, right? |Maybe a wicked ghost would appear!"
Abigail,Sun_17,"Hmm, interesting..."
Abigail,Sun_18,Well that's an interesting theory! 
Abigail,Sun_nothing,"You know, that wouldn't be so bad. "
Abigail,Wed2,"Oh, hi @. Taking a break from your work?# #Me too. Oh! Nothing physical... just some online classes I'm taking."
Abigail,Tue4,"Hi, I'm glad to see you. # #I want to take my mind off things for a while... how is your day going?"
Abigail,Sat6,You came all this way to visit me? That's nice. # #So have you been exploring the mountain caves at all?# #Interesting. I'd like to go there myself one of these days. 
Abigail,Mon8,"...Oh, @! Hi. # #Want to hang out for a while? Here! Let me read your palm. "
Abigail,Thu10,"Hi. # #Do you feel like everything seems unreal lately? # #Not in a bad way, though. "
Abigail,Fri6,"The birds were happily chirping today. They're too simple to understand the future.# #It's better to be like them, isn't it?"
Abigail,Event_VideoGame_Yes,Great! I'm sure you'll be able to beat this level with ease. 
Abigail,Event_VideoGame_No,"Oh? ... I guess I'll never get past this level, then... "
Abigail,Event_Grave1,"See? You understand why I'm out here, then.# #I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure! "
Abigail,Event_Grave2,"Sure. I don't want to kill anything, either. I just want to do a little exploring without risking my neck!# #I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure! "
Abigail,Event_Grave3,"Oh, it's because I'm a girl... isn't it? Ugh... ^Why? I'm just as strong as you! # #I'm not some fragile princess.. I can take care of myself! # #I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure! "
Abigail,Event_Grave4,"Really? That's surprising. # #I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure! "
Abigail,Event_Rain_1,I see... 
Abigail,Event_Rain_2,Yea... I guess you would be one to appreciate this somber ambience.
Abigail,Event_Rain_3,...That's true. 
Abigail,Event_Tragic_1,Yeah... I guess my own life is okay... 
Abigail,Event_Tragic_2,...! 
Abigail,Event_Tragic_3,I would feel better if I could believe that...# #But I don't. 
Abigail,Event_Cave2_1,@... 
Abigail,Event_Cave2_2,@... I'm alright. 
Abigail,Event_Cave_1,...okay. 
Abigail,Event_Cave_2,"I guess when you have something to lose, it's normal to be afraid... "
Abigail,Event_Cave_3,"...Um, okay. Sorry. "
Abigail,summer_1,Summer's here. It's not really my favorite season.# #The air is so muggy I feel like I'm floating in soup.
Abigail,summer_Mon,"My pet guinea pig, David, just hates this hot weather. He's fussy."
Abigail,summer_Tue,The air is so thick with honey and nectar all summer. I almost feel dizzy. 
Abigail,summer_Wed,Have you decorated your house at all? That's what I'd be doing if I had a house.
Abigail,summer_6,"I went to the beach last night, after dark... Sometimes you can see strange lights bobbing over the sea.# #Or maybe that was just a dream I had... It doesn't feel real anymore."
Abigail,summer_Thu,If I knew how to use a sword I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now. It's probably nice and cool in there.
Abigail,summer_Thu4,"Ew, I hope I don't get a tan this summer. "
Abigail,summer_Fri,"I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything."
Abigail,summer_Sat,"I'm looking forward to fall... the cool mountain breeze, the swirling red petals, the smell of mushrooms... "
Abigail,summer_Sun,"Do you ever get an urge to go exploring, @?# summer_Sun_old#Okay... pretend you just won a free vacation. Where would you go?# 25 0 Sun_25#The beach# 26 30 Sun_26#In a dark cave# 26 30 Sun_26#The old, gnarled forest# 25 0 Sun_25#Joja Mega-Mall"
Abigail,summer_Sun_old," 25#I do... but you probably wouldn't like the places I'm thinking about...|Maybe we'll be neighbors someday. I think we both have similar, weird tastes. "
Abigail,Sun_25,Huh. I think that would get old fast.
Abigail,Sun_26,Yea! That sounds wonderful. 
Abigail,summer_Wed2,"I would love to live in an old farmhouse like you.# #The creak of a floorboard, the slow plumes of dust whispering through the rafters... There's something special about an old building, isn't there?"
Abigail,summer_Tue4,"You're an interesting guy, @. I'm glad you moved here. ^You're an interesting lady, @. I'm glad you moved here. "
Abigail,summer_Sat6,I'm actually enjoying myself this summer. # #It's funny how quickly one's outlook can change.
Abigail,summer_Mon8,"I used to think Pelican Town was kinda drab, but lately I'm starting to love some things about it. "
Abigail,summer_Thu10,"Wow, you look nice today.# #I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh... "
Abigail,summer_Fri10,Do you ever get lonely on your farm?
Abigail,fall_1,Ah... Fall's here! # #I was getting so tired of summer.
Abigail,fall_Mon,I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today.
Abigail,fall_Tue," joja#I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.|Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop! "
Abigail,fall_Wed,"I can't wait to see some pumpkins this year. # #The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun."
Abigail,fall_Thu,# AbigailHAND#Last night I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic . Does that mean anything?# # doesn't seem to be interested in talking right now.
Abigail,fall_Sat, cc#I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.|Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?
Abigail,fall_Sun,Hmm... what should I do tonight?# fall_Sun_old#I was thinking about dyeing my hair again... what do you think?# 27 10 Sun_27#Dye it black.# 27 10 Sun_27#Why not blonde?# 27 20 Sun_WildColor#How about bubblegum pink?# 28 0 Sun_28#I like your hair just the way it is!
Abigail,fall_Sun_old, 27#I was going to dye my hair but then I decided against it.|Yes? What is it?
Abigail,Sun_27,"I guess that's a pretty safe choice, huh?# #I'll think about it."
Abigail,Sun_28,Of course that's what you'd say. 
Abigail,Sun_WildColor,You're always good for a laugh. 
Abigail,fall_Wed2,Are you growing pumpkins on your farm this year?# #Save one for me! 
Abigail,fall_Tue4,"I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best. # #I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone. "
Abigail,fall_Sat6,Hi. # #Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?
Abigail,fall_Mon8,"You know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day...# #But how would that ever happen? "
Abigail,fall_Thu10,"I had an interesting dream last night, with you in it.# #It was a good dream. "
Abigail,fall_Fri6,"I wish the season lasted a little longer. # #When the wind really picks up, I almost feel like a kid again."
Abigail,fall_Fri10,"I usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore. # #@, what are your plans for the future?"
Abigail,winter_1,"Well, fall is over... # #But I like winter, too! "
Abigail,winter_Mon,It's just too cold to go outside much.# #But I do enjoy building a snowgoon. 
Abigail,winter_Tue,Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?
Abigail,winter_Wed,Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?
Abigail,spring_12,I'm definitely going to enter the egg hunt tomorrow. Are you?
Abigail,spring_23,"Well, tomorrow is the flower dance. Dancing is alright, but they make me wear this stupid white dress... "
Abigail,winter_7,I'm looking forward to making a snow man tomorrow.
Abigail,fall_26,Will I see you tomorrow at the Spirit's Eve festival? Look for me in the haunted maze. 
Abigail,summer_10,"Everyone's excited for the Luau tomorrow. Maybe a little nervous, too, considering the Governor will be here."
Abigail,summer_27,You can't miss tomorrow's festival. It's one of the most beautiful wonders of the valley.
Abigail,winter_24,I'm going to eat so much cranberry sauce tomorrow. 
Abigail,winter_Thu,"Another year is almost over.# #It goes by so fast, doesn't it? "
Abigail,winter_Fri,One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different.
Abigail,winter_Sat,It's the weekend!# #That means I can play twice as many video games. # #Bye.
Abigail,winter_Sun,"Oh, hello.# winter_Sun_old#I made these two drawings. What do you think?# 29 20 Sun_29#I like the jungle island and the tiger.# 30 5 Sun_30#I like the orc with the battleaxe.# 29 -50 Sun_Bad#I don't like either of them."
Abigail,winter_Sun_old, 29#Remember those drawings I showed you a while ago? I accidentally threw them away. |Remember that drawing I showed you with the orc? I entered it into an online contest and won 50g! 
Abigail,Sun_29,Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense.
Abigail,Sun_30,I'm glad. It's embarrassing to share your art with others. But I think you and I are on the same page.
Abigail,Sun_Bad,Rude! Why would you hurt my feelings like that? You're so insensitive! 
Abigail,winter_Wed2,"Hi. If you're ever bored, you can always hang out in my room.# #As long as I'm not changing, of course!"
Abigail,winter_Tue4,"It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share. "
Abigail,winter_Sat6,I've been daydreaming a lot lately...# #Oh! You want to know what it's about? Well... # #...It's a secret. 
Abigail,winter_Thu10,"Another year is almost over...# #But this was a really good year, don't you think? "
Abigail,winter_Wed6,It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.# #And that means you can hang out with me more often! 
Abigail,winter_Fri10,"@, there's something I want to tell you...# #It's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... # #That's all... "
Alex,Introduction,"Oh, hey. So you're the new guy, huh? Cool.^Hey, you're the new girl, huh? I think we're going to get along great. I'm Alex.# #I'll see you around."
Alex,Resort_Entering,"Finally, we're here!"
Alex,Resort_Leaving,Aw... I guess it can't last forever. 
Alex,Resort_Wander,I knew I shoulda brought a frisbee... Oh well. 
Alex,Resort_Wander_2,"I wonder if anyone would be up for a volleyball tournament.# #Don't worry, I'll go easy! "
Alex,Resort_Shore,"I wonder how far I could swim out, and still make it back?# #I'm guessing at least a mile.# #... Don't worry, I'm not going to try it. "
Alex,Resort_Chair,"Aren't you hot in that outfit? C'mon, man... It's the beach!^Aren't you hot in that outfit? You gotta get some ocean breeze goin'!"
Alex,Resort_Towel,"With this island open, there's no excuse to be pasty anymore!"
Alex,Resort_Towel_2,"Phew, it feels good to finally get these abs a little sunlight.# #Kind of a shame to have them hidden away all the time back home."
Alex,Resort_Towel_3,"When I go pro, I'll vacation on islands all around the world.# #But for now, this place will do just fine! "
Alex,Resort_Bar,I'm ordering a banana shake with two scoops of protein powder.
Alex,Resort,Ah... The island life. I could get used to this!
Alex,danceRejection,Nah... I'm gonna ask someone else. Good luck.
Alex,divorced,I thought we had something special... I guess I was wrong. 
Alex,dumped_Guys,You're not worth my time. 
Alex,secondChance_Guys,"I don't know if I can trust you anymore, but I'm willing to give you a chance. "
Alex,breakUp,"You're giving me wha...? # # ... Got it. Alright... well, you've made your choice. You're not gonna see me begging. "
Alex,Mon,Did you know I was an all-star quarterback in high school? It's true. # #See this little star on my jacket here? That proves it.
Alex,Tue,"The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays.#e#You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale.# # ... I wish there were more girls in this town, know what I mean? ^Hey, do you wanna hang out with me at the beach some time? Do you have a bikini?"
Alex,Wed,"Looks like a good day to play catch, huh? # # Wed_01_old#I'd ask you to throw the ball around, but you don't really seem like the sports type.^If you weren't a girl I'd ask you to play catch.# 6 0 Wed_01_02#I'm fine just watching you from a distance.# 5 15 Wed_01_01#I want to play catch with you!# 5 0 Wed_01_03#(angry) What's that supposed to mean?"
Alex,Wed_01_old,# 5#Go long! ...just kidding. Hahaha.|I just wish I had someone to play catch with... 
Alex,Wed_01_01,"Really? I guess I underestimated you.# #My arm's a little sore, but maybe next time."
Alex,Wed_01_02,"Yeah, some people just aren't made for sports."
Alex,Wed_01_03,Uh... nevermind.
Alex,Thu,The air's starting to warm up... I'm feeling pumped.
Alex,Fri,"Hey, what's up farmer guy?^Hey, it's farm girl. Did you get new pants? You're doing something right.#e#Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups!#e#Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?"
Alex,Sat,"My arms are really sore, but that's the sign of progress for a guy like me.#e#I must've done a thousand push-ups yesterday."
Alex,Sun,"Hey.# #What, you wanna talk to me? I'm busy."
Alex,Sun2,"Hey, @.# #That's right, I remember your name."
Alex,Sun4,"Hey, @.# #How's your day going?"
Alex,Fri4,"Hey, @. I'm glad you stopped by.#e#I'm not ashamed to say that I love my Grandma!# #Now Grandpa, on the other hand...# #Just kidding. "
Alex,Tue6,Nothing's better than an energetic day at the beach with your friends... right?
Alex,Mon8,"You know, I used to want fame and fortune, but lately I've been starting to sing a different tune. In the end it's the humble little things that satisfy, don't you think?# #I still want to go pro, but it's not the most important thing in the world."
Alex,Fri8,Hi @. You look sporty today. ^Hey @. Did you do something different with your hair? Something keeps grabbing my attention. 
Alex,Sat10,I've been having a hard time staying focused lately. 
Alex,Event_beach1,Of course you do. If you didn't I'd think you were crazy. Or some kind of nerd.
Alex,Event_beach2,Really? You must be some kind of weirdo. # #Sorry.
Alex,Event_books1,"No, I'm not! You're just trying to flatter me. "
Alex,Event_books2,"Yeah, I guess you're right... "
Alex,Event_books3,You were supposed to disagree with me. 
Alex,event_box1,Yes... I know. That's why I've been so determined to be successful with my sports stuff... # #Make it or not... As long as I try my hardest I think she'd be proud. Thanks.
Alex,event_box2,Wow... It's the anniversary of my Mom's death! Have a heart... 
Alex,event_box3,"...Thanks, @.# #You... you're different than the other guys. More sensitive. ^You've become my best friend in the whole town... # #I'm glad.^Is that embarrassing to say? "
Alex,event_box4,"That doesn't make me feel any better, jerk. "
Alex,Event_parents1,That's an interesting thought...
Alex,Event_parents2,They would never do that! 
Alex,Event_parents3,...Maybe you're right... I dunno. 
Alex,summer_1,Hey. Summer is definitely the best time of year.# #Right now is great because we've got the whole season to look forward to. Catch you later.
Alex,summer_Mon,"Hey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt.^Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going. # #The more I practice this summer, the easier it'll be for me to go pro.# #Then you'd be able to say you knew me once. Cool, huh?"
Alex,summer_Tue,"If my hair wasn't so popular with the ladies, I swear I'd shave it all off in a second.# # ... Life can be tough."
Alex,summer_Wed,"Hey farm guy, I've got a question for you.^Hey Farm girl, I've got a question for you.# # summer_Wed_01_old#Do you think I'll ever turn pro?# 52 30 summer_Wed_01_01#You're destined to be a sports legend# 52 0 summer_Wed_01_02#Maybe, if you practice a lot# 53 -50 summer_Wed_01_03#No, you'll most likely fail and become a salesman"
Alex,summer_Wed_01_old," 52#Hey, when I turn pro you can say you were my first ""fan"". Not bad, huh?|Hey, I've been practicing twice as hard so I can turn pro and prove you wrong. You just wait. "
Alex,summer_Wed_01_01,"Hey, now that's what I'm talking about! # #You're cooler than I thought."
Alex,summer_Wed_01_02,"Yeah, well I'm so good I'm not going to have to practice all that much. "
Alex,summer_Wed_01_03,"That's insane. You're just jealous that I'm talented and popular and you're not. ^That's ridiculous. You're just jealous that I'm way more popular than you'll ever be, freak. # #Get away from me. "
Alex,summer_Thu,"Hey, you must be getting pretty strong working on that farm all day.^Hey, you must be getting pretty fit working on that farm all day.# #Maybe you'll reach my level some day. Something to look forward to, huh?# #Why do you have that look on your face?"
Alex,summer_Fri,What do you want?# #I've got more important things to do right now.
Alex,summer_Sat,Mmmm... I smell a barbeque.# #Damn I could go for a burger.
Alex,summer_Sun,"I got these new shoes yesterday 'cuz my old pair had a brown smudge.# #I just threw them into the garbage. I would've donated them but I don't like the idea of some weirdo wearing my shoes, ya know?# #...What? "
Alex,summer_Sun4,"Oh wow...your shoes are a little dirty... but that's fine, too!# #Different people have different tastes I guess."
Alex,summer_Thu4,"Hey, you look like you're getting into some good shape this summer!# #All that farm work is paying off, huh?"
Alex,summer_Mon4,"Hey, nice tan."
Alex,summer_Fri6,"Sorry my room is so messy. # #It's just hard to always remember to clean. I'm trying to get better, though."
Alex,summer_Wed8,"You know, I actually wouldn't mind being a farmer... it seems a lot like playing sports, in a way.# #I like being outdoors and doing things with my hands."
Alex,summer_Sat10,I've been trying to do more reading lately... I feel like I've been neglecting my brain for years because of my athletic obsession.
Alex,fall_1,"Sure, it's getting colder... But it's still warm enough for sports!# #That's all I care about."
Alex,fall_Mon,"My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying.# #I was like, '...Grams, don't fret. I'm turning pro!' # #Studying is for nerds, anyway."
Alex,fall_Wed,"Hey, I want to ask you something.^Hey, can I ask you something?# # fall_Wed_01_old#Do you think the ladies like my haircut?^What do you think about my haircut?# 54 30 fall_Wed_01_01#It looks very fashionable.# 55 -30 fall_Wed_01_02#It looks like some kind of fungal growth."
Alex,fall_Wed_01_old,I put too much gel in my hair today. It kind of hurts.# #Don't touch it!# #...what?
Alex,fall_Wed_01_01,"Yeah, I know. That's why I have it like this."
Alex,fall_Wed_01_02,Yeah right. You're just jealous that I look so good.
Alex,fall_Thu,"What's up?# #Isn't your name, like, , or something?# #Oh. It's @? Okay. Sorry."
Alex,fall_Fri,"I'm going to do two hundred sit-ups tonight.# #I'm pretty dedicated, aren't I? # #Need anything else?"
Alex,fall_Sat,I think you can find salmon in the river this time of year.# #At least that's what I heard.
Alex,fall_Sun,"Hey, the gridball game is on today!#e#Sundays are pretty awesome in the fall. "
Alex,fall_Thu2,"What's up, @?"
Alex,fall_Fri6,I'm going to do a ton of sit-ups tonight.# #You have to work really hard if you want to achieve your maximum potential.
Alex,fall_Mon4,My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying.# #Maybe she's right... 
Alex,fall_Wed8,I finally took the plunge... I've decided to stop putting gel in my hair.# #I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who only liked me because I have gel in my hair.
Alex,fall_Thu10,@! Um... Hi. 
Alex,winter_1,Winter is kind of lame. There's too much snow to do anything fun.# #I guess some people like it.
Alex,winter_Mon,You like the snow? Me... I'm just looking forward to spring.
Alex,winter_Tue,"Hey, can you go find Haley and tell her I said 'hi'?"
Alex,winter_Tue_inlaw_Haley,"Oh, hey. How's the married life coming along? "
Alex,winter_Wed,"People stay indoors a lot during the winter, and do boring stuff. # #Maybe if I read a book I'd be less bored... nah."
Alex,winter_Thu,"When I turn pro, I'll be so rich that I'll get a vacation home in the tropics.# #Then I won't have to deal with these boring winters."
Alex,winter_Fri,You came all the way through the snow to see me?# #I guess that makes sense.
Alex,winter_Sat,There's some weird people living in this town.# #...like that guy Sebastian. Why does he wear black all the time?# #I don't get it.
Alex,winter_Sun,"Hey, the gridball game is on today!#e#This might be my favorite day of the week."
Alex,winter_Fri4,You came all the way through the snow to see me?# #That's nice of you. 
Alex,winter_Sat6,"I guess it's interesting that some people are totally different than us, you know?# #I don't always understand why others act the way they do, but that's fine."
Alex,winter_Tue4,"Hey, @. Could you do me a favor? # #If you see Haley, tell her I'm busy. # #Thanks."
Alex,winter_Tue4_inlaw_Haley,"I'll admit... I was a little jealous when you and Haley got married. But, hey... It's a chance for me to learn something new about myself. "
Alex,winter_Wed8,You know what? I'm going to start reading a book!
Alex,winter_Thu6,I wish I could control the weather.
Alex,winter_Thu10,"If I ever make a lot of money, I'll make sure all my friends and family are taken care of.# #That means you, too. "
Elliott,Introduction,"Ah, the new farmer we've all been expecting... and whose arrival has sparked many a conversation!# #I'm Elliott... I live in the little cabin by the beach. It's a pleasure to meet you."
Elliott,Resort_Entering,That was quite the ride!
Elliott,Resort_Leaving,I'll see you back in the valley.
Elliott,Resort_Leaving_2,Hopefully a crab hasn't snuck onto my clothes again. # #Imagine crawling out of a pocket and finding yourself on a beach hundreds of miles from home! # #Hmmm... Perhaps this could make for an interesting novel...
Elliott,Resort_Chair,I'm just taking a quick break to slather some coconut oil on my body. 
Elliott,Resort_Bar,"Gus, I'll order a round for everyone!# # ... Oh... I don't have the G. # #Heh heh... Never mind!"
Elliott,Resort_Wander,I've heard rumors of pirates coming to shore near here at night. They say it can get pretty wild!
Elliott,Resort,"I must admit, this beach blows my own humble strand out of the water."
Elliott,Resort_2,Oh dear! Some seaweed has tangled itself in my hair.# #That's the trouble with relaxing on the beach.
Elliott,danceRejection,Excuse me... not today. 
Elliott,divorced,... # #Why do you torment me? Can't you see you've shattered all my hopes and dreams? 
Elliott,dumped_Guys,Go away. I can't bear to see you. 
Elliott,secondChance_Guys,You've hurt me beyond measure... but I'm willing to leave the past behind us. 
Elliott,breakUp,Ah... the wilted bouquet. A sight I'd hoped to never see... # #I suppose there are other horizons to set my eyes upon... 
Elliott,Mon,"I'm kind of new to this town myself, but I really feel at home. # #I moved here only a year before you."
Elliott,Mon4,I hope you've come to think of this place as 'home'.
Elliott,Tue,"A great idea can pass through your head when you least expect it... but if your mind is too busy you might miss it.# #Well, I really must get back to my work."
Elliott,Tue6,"The sweet friction of pen and paper is the music of my soul. # #That's why I chose this beach as my home, so that I could have peace and quiet to do my work."
Elliott,Wed,The forest is a wonderful place. Have you been there?
Elliott,Wed8,"Sorry, I'm feeling morose today. # #I wish there was more certainty about the future. # #I don't want to grow old as a lonely hermit on this beach... "
Elliott,Thu2,I can't seem to find the inspiration to begin writing my novel... 
Elliott,Thu4,I've been feeling hopeful lately. Perhaps the weather is changing.
Elliott,Thu6,"Sometimes I wonder if I might just have an inflated self-image and no real skills... # #No, no... I'm not fishing for compliments. Though they are appreciated..."
Elliott,Thu8,# elliottApol#It's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend. # #It feels good to have a close friend like you.
Elliott,Thu,"Hello, @.# #Are you well?"
Elliott,Fri,The fresh air of this valley is good for body and mind.# #A quick stroll outdoors always invigorates me.
Elliott,Fri4,Ah... do not get too close to my hair with a torch... 
Elliott,Fri8,I'll admit... it takes me several hours each morning to make my hair look this good.
Elliott,Sat,You probably wouldn't like it inside my cabin. It's dark and full of spiders. 
Elliott,Sat4,Please excuse the sorry state of my cabin.
Elliott,Sat6,"Some people are shy. Keep showing interest in them and they'll get comfortable around you.# #Everyone likes to have friends, even that grumpy blacksmith."
Elliott,Sun,Hello. I hope your new farming life is panning out as you'd hoped?
Elliott,Sun6,"Oh, @! I was hoping you'd show up.# #It's always a pleasure to see you. "
Elliott,event_idea1,"Mystery, huh? It's definitely an exciting genre. I'll remember that."
Elliott,event_idea2,"Ah, one of the classic genres. I'll remember that."
Elliott,event_idea3,I would've never guessed! I suppose even those of the 'earthiest' profession sometimes have their heads in the stars. # #I'll remember that.
Elliott,event_boat1,... I was worried you might not feel this way about another man. ^So am I. 
Elliott,event_boat2,Oh! I'm so sorry. 
Elliott,event_toast1,Well...okay.# #Here's to @!
Elliott,event_toast2,That's a great idea! # #Here's to us!
Elliott,event_toast3,Hmmph...forget it. 
Elliott,event_toast4,"Ah, to a harmonious future for the community... what a virtuous idea.# #Here's to Pelican Town!"
Elliott,summer_Mon,A gentle little sunbeam woke me up this morning. I've never felt so refreshed. # #I'm sorry if that isn't very interesting to you.
Elliott,summer_Mon4,I know that I am kind of an 'oddball'.# #I hope you don't mind. 
Elliott,summer_Mon6,"@, I know you have faith in my abilities as a writer. That means a lot to me. "
Elliott,summer_Tue,I've encountered some beautiful shells in front of my house.# #I would imagine the rarer varieties to be quite valuable.
Elliott,summer_Tue6,"I write in hopes of connecting with others through time and space. # # ...times are changing, though. People don't read anymore. "
Elliott,summer_Wed,It must be satisfying to follow your crop from seed to harvest.# #It's as if your essence is infused into the fruit. 
Elliott,summer_Thu,Oh dear! My shoes are filled with sand. # #That's the trouble with living on the beach.
Elliott,summer_Fri,@? You look puzzled.# #I guess the hot summer air can make us a little dizzy.
Elliott,summer_Sat,"The sun is angry today... My skin is a bit too delicate, I'm afraid."
Elliott,summer_Sun,You came all the way here just to talk to me? How kind. 
Elliott,summer_Sun4,Visit my cabin whenever you like. I could use the company. 
Elliott,fall_Mon,Hello @.# #Make sure and take breaks from your work now and then.
Elliott,fall_Mon4,Come visit me if you need a break from your labors. # #I'm usually at my house.
Elliott,fall_Tue,"It's been said that a pirate's ship, full of plundered gold, shipwrecked here a long time ago."
Elliott,fall_Tue8,"@, I was just thinking about you. # #Maybe you sensed it. # #So! Tell me about your day."
Elliott,fall_Wed8,"I wouldn't mind trying my hand at farming.# #The quiet atmosphere of a farm might be a good source of literary inspiration, don't you think? "
Elliott,fall_Thu,Oh dear! A tiny crab appears to have made his home in my shirt pocket. # #That's the trouble with living on the beach.
Elliott,fall_Fri4,"My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all night. # #Sometimes I envy you, @."
Elliott,fall_Fri,My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all morning. 
Elliott,fall_Fri10,"@, when you're around... I feel unusually creative. # #I know... strange, but it's true."
Elliott,fall_Sat,It gets windy this time of year. Marvelous! 
Elliott,fall_Sun,I have to remember to water my plants today. And not with sea water this time!
Elliott,winter_Mon,You've come to visit me in the cold?# #I could do with a respite from my lonely labors.
Elliott,winter_Mon4,"@, you've trudged through the snow to visit me?# #I'm honored! "
Elliott,winter_Tue,People have scraped a living off the sea for thousands of years.# #I just go to the grocery store. 
Elliott,winter_Tue10,"@, I had a feeling that you would show up.# #Perhaps we're connected by an other-worldly thread. "
Elliott,-winter_Wed,"A day can never be boring when you follow the whims of your imagination. # #Sorry, am I babbling on about nonsense?"
Elliott,winter_Thu,Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea.# #How does it make you feel?
Elliott,winter_Thu6,"Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea.# #Whenever I smell the sea, it reminds me of my youth. The ocean really impressed me as a child."
Elliott,winter_Fri,"I have to brush my hair daily, or else it'll clump up into messy knots.# #It's a lot of work.# #I'm surprised I haven't just shaved it off in a fit of passion. # #I suppose I am too vain."
Elliott,winter_Sat,"I've been doing little indoor exercises, since it's often too cold to go out.# #Sorry if it's a little humid in the cabin. "
Elliott,winter_Sun,I really should scrub my floorboards today. I think an algae is starting to form. # #Do you make time for cleaning?
Emily,Introduction,"Ooh!... I can read it on your face. You're going to love it here in Pelican Town.# #If you're ever looking for something to do in the evening, stop by the saloon. That's where I work!"
Emily,Resort_Entering,"Oh, I like this place! It's full of parrots!"
Emily,Resort_Leaving,Ah... my lungs feel perfect.
Emily,Resort_Shore,Can you feel it? The ocean has a profound healing energy.
Emily,Resort_Chair,"Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!"
Emily,Resort_Bar,It's nice to be on this side of the bar for once! 
Emily,Resort,"If you open your heart to the sun, you can feel a loving energy inside of you. "
Emily,Resort_Dance, is lost in the music.
Emily,danceRejection,I'm very sorry... but I've already agreed to dance with someone else. 
Emily,divorced,"@... You broke my heart... I just can't talk to you anymore. # #Please, let me try to heal... "
Emily,dumped_Girls,... 
Emily,breakUp,B...But I thought we had a special bond... 
Emily,reject_866,"Oh, that's beautiful... I have a friend who would love that! But she lives far from here..."
Emily,secondChance_Girls,@... I'm ready to give you a second chance. I still have faith that there's a good person inside of you. 
Emily,Mon,"Have I told you Haley and I are sisters? Strange, isn't it?"
Emily,Mon2,"I have a secret hobby, but I won't say any more.# #Maybe I'll show you some day. "
Emily,Mon4,"This world is full of spirits and magic... Some don't believe me, but I know it's true.# #I can see it in your eyes... you believe in the other world, like me."
Emily,Mon6,I wish Haley would get a job or at least contribute to cooking and cleaning. # #I think she's hoping to marry someone rich. 
Emily,Mon6_inlaw_Haley,"I have to say, now that Haley's gone I've had a much easier time keeping things in order."
Emily,Mon8,"There's good people in this town who just can't seem to find happiness. It makes me sad. # #Working in the saloon, I hear first-hand about everyone's problems. "
Emily,Tue,I work part-time at Gus' saloon. It pays the bills.
Emily,Tue4,"I'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring. # #I made these clothes from scratch, see?"
Emily,Tue6,"Oh, hi... It's nice of you to visit me like this. "
Emily,Tue8,"You know, @... I think the future looks bright for both of us."
Emily,Wed,"I've heard rumors of rare and powerful magic rings, forged long ago by forgotten civilizations. I'm not sure if it's true or just a fairy tale."
Emily,Wed4,"You catch fish? I just hope you treat the poor things humanely. # #Every critter deserves our respect, even the slimy ones."
Emily,Wed6,Have faith... every day you're taking one more step on the path of your destiny.
Emily,Wed8,"Hi, @. # #I always knew we'd become close like this..."
Emily,Thu,I hope you're farming in a sustainable way. The valley's ecosystem is fragile!# #How do I know? I have a strong gut-feeling!
Emily,Thu4,Sometimes the flowers speak to me... each one has a different story to tell!
Emily,Fri,"Ah, spring. The season of pastels. I actually prefer jewel tones, myself.# #Oh, excuse me! I was mumbling about fashion again, wasn't I?"
Emily,Sat,"I like making my own clothes, but it's not easy to get cloth.# #And it's such a long trip to the city."
Emily,Sat6,"Do you ever think about the texture of fabric, @? Each texture has a distinct personality... feel my dress... see?"
Emily,Sun,"Hi @!# #Do you raise sheep in your barn? You can turn their wool into beautiful bolts of cloth!# #You'll need a loom, though. You can make them yourself if you know the crafting recipe."
Emily,Sun4,"This house was left in our care by my parents. They've been traveling the world for the last two years.# #We have no idea when they'll be back.# #I enjoy living here, though. It's a beautiful area and the town is nice."
Emily,event_dance1,Thank you!
Emily,event_dance2,Um... Okay. Sorry you didn't like it. I guess those three years of practice were a complete waste... 
Emily,event_dance3,Did you really think so? That's exactly the effect I was shooting for! # #I'm so glad you liked it.
Emily,summer_Mon,Haley is a picky eater. It's so hard to cook for her.
Emily,summer_Mon4,Eating healthy is very important to me. I want to live a long and active life.
Emily,summer_Mon_inlaw_Haley,Haley and I get along much better now that she's moved out. I look forward to her visits!
Emily,summer_Tue,"Hello there, @.# #I feel lazy today. "
Emily,summer_Tue6,"I feel bad for Linus. People judge him, but he's just living a different lifestyle. # #I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others."
Emily,summer_Sun6,"Hi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we? # #That's fine with me. You're a cool guy.^I'm glad. "
Emily,summer_Sun8,"Hi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we? # #This may sound weird, but I've always been certain this would happen."
Emily,summer_Wed,"It doesn't rain much in summer, does it?# #That just means more watering work for you, huh?# #Or do you enjoy the sunny weather?"
Emily,summer_Thu,I consider the bees and butterflies to be my special friends!
Emily,summer_Fri,If I wasn't so busy I'd come help you on the farm!# #But Gus would be upset if I had another job... 
Emily,summer_Fri6,"You know, I'm sure Gus would understand if I wanted to leave the Saloon someday.# #There's so much out there, I can't stay a barmaid forever. "
Emily,summer_Sat,Don't overwork yourself or you might end up in Harvey's clinic!
Emily,summer_Sun,Hi @!
Emily,summer_Sun4,It's around this time of year that my good friends visit the region... I mean the parrots!
Emily,fall_1,"Well, fall is here. Time to plant some new crops, huh?"
Emily,fall_Mon,"It's good weather for a picnic, isn't it?"
Emily,fall_Mon8,If I didn't have to work I'd suggest we go on a nice picnic!
Emily,fall_Tue,Hello. Did you have a good summer?
Emily,fall_Tue4,"Hi @! I bet your farm did great this past summer, huh?# #You're an excellent farmer. "
Emily,fall_Wed,My friend runs a shop in the desert. If you ever go there stop in and say hi for me.# #I think she sells some rare products.
Emily,fall_Thu,"Are you friends with Clint? He's a nice guy, if you get to know him.# #He gets lonely working in his shop all day. But he's so shy he has trouble making new friends."
Emily,fall_Thu8,I think Clint's mad at me. He never looks at me anymore... # #I always thought we were friends. 
Emily,fall_Fri,Another beautiful fall day.# #It's a pity it'll soon be over.
Emily,fall_Fri6,"Smell that clean air? It's lovely, isn't it?# #I just fear that the Joja Co.'s of the world will take this away from us. "
Emily,fall_Sat,"Keep your mind open and some interesting things might take root.# #Anyway, how is your day going?"
Emily,fall_Sat6,I don't have any huge plans for life. I prefer not to stress about the future.
Emily,fall_Sun,Nothing like a sunny sunday to lift the spirits!
Emily,fall_Sun6,"There's so many invisible barriers holding us back. Why can't people learn to let go and celebrate freedom?# #Me? Well, you know what they say... 'You can't cage a wild Junimo'."
Emily,fall_Sun10,"You're such a nice person, @! Thanks for being my friend. "
Emily,winter_Mon,Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head!
Emily,winter_Mon10,Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head! I wouldn't want you to get hurt!
Emily,winter_Tue,"Oh, hello @! # #You must be getting very good at farming by now, huh?"
Emily,winter_Tue2,I bet you're an excellent farmer by now!
Emily,winter_Tue4,I think my hair is frozen solid... 
Emily,winter_Wed,Haley and I aren't made for such a big house. It's a hassle to keep it clean.# #Ah well. I really shouldn't be complaining.# #Your farmhouse seems nice and cozy. 
Emily,winter_Thu,It must be so cold for the poor fish. # #I wonder if any fish hibernate? Maybe I should ask Demetrius.
Emily,winter_Fri,If I wasn't so busy I'd help you dig around in that cave by the lake.# #I bet there are some powerful crystals inside there.
Emily,winter_Sat,"Do you know how to cook 'Bean Hotpot'?# #I like that dish quite a bit. # #It's hard to get fresh ingredients in the winter, huh?"
Emily,winter_Sun,Hi!# #...Yes?
Emily,winter_Sun6,"My sister and I might fight sometimes, but I would really miss her if she left.# #I think she'll become a very nice young lady some day... Don't tell her I said that. # #So, is there anything you want to talk about?"
Emily,winter_Sun6_inlaw_Haley,Say hi to my sister for me! And remind her to visit me tomorrow.
Haley,Introduction,"Oh... you're that new farmer boy, aren't you?^Oh... You're that new farmer girl, or whatever. Aren't you?# #Huh? Oh... I'm Haley.# #Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be cute.^Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be pretty... Actually, nevermind. "
Haley,Resort_Entering,I saw a dolphin on the way in!
Haley,Resort_Leaving,There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good.
Haley,Resort_Shore,It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?
Haley,Resort_Shore_2,"Wow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon! # #I bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo.# #I have to remember to bring my camera next time."
Haley,Resort_Towel,Getting the perfect tan is an artform...# #It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right. 
Haley,Resort_Towel_2,Laying out on a tropical beach.# # I think I've finally found my place in the universe.# #But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either! 
Haley,Resort_Towel_3,"Emily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City.# #City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it? "
Haley,Resort_Chair,I painted my toenails blue to match the sea. What do you think? 
Haley,Resort_Bar,"Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me! "
Haley,Resort,This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!
Haley,danceRejection,Ew... No.
Haley,divorced,I'll be fine on my own... # #Thanks for the memories. # #Why are you still clinging to me? Go live your own life. 
Haley,breakUp,"Agh! # #Oh... hmph. Beat me to it, huh? Alright..."
Haley,dumped_Girls,I've got nothing to say to you! 
Haley,secondChance_Girls,"Alright, alright... I'm done giving you the cold shoulder. Just promise me you'll never, ever lie to me again. "
Haley,Mon,"This town is so small. It sucks. # #I have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes. # #That's why I usually just order online.# #What?"
Haley,Tue,Nice shoes.^Nice makeup.# #Are those made out of plastic?^Or wait... Are you even wearing any?# #I'm bored.
Haley,Wed,The only thing I like about this town is the beach. 
Haley,Thu,# HaleyClothes#I've decided I am going to organize my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!# # I could really go for a cupcake right now.# #Do you need something?
Haley,Fri, is ignoring you.
Haley,Fri2,"Don't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do?# #I couldn't stand getting all dirty like that.# #You probably get a nice tan, though."
Haley,Sat,I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here.
Haley,Sun,My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related. 
Haley,Wed8,There are only two things I like about this town.# #One of them is the beach.# #The other one is a secret! 
Haley,Tue2,"I wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning?# #This isn't the best time of year for shells, though."
Haley,Wed4,I'm glad that the flowers are starting to bloom.# #Those pink ones smell so good. 
Haley,Fri6,I need to find some kind of hobby other than shopping.# #I've decided I want to expand my horizons.# #Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?
Haley,Mon6,"I used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it.# #If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community."
Haley,Thu6,I cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay!# #But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen...
Haley,Sun6,I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes.
Haley,Sat8,"# haleySeagull#Yesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing. # #You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever."

Haley,Event_clean1, ... 
Haley,Event_clean2,NO!! I'm not going to do it! # #You guys are both stupid! 
Haley,Event_clean3,"She should take the 'high road'? What's that supposed to mean? # #You think I'm being a baby, huh? "
Haley,Event_jar1,"Great, then you shouldn't have any problem opening this jar for me! "
Haley,Event_jar2,Oh... you aren't? Hmmm... # #Well could you try opening this jar for me anyways?
Haley,Event_darkroom1,"Aw, thanks! "
Haley,Event_darkroom2,Oh! I thought you knew.# #This room's for developing photos.
Haley,Event_darkroom3,Is that so...? 
Haley,Event_darkroom4,"Aw, thanks! "
Haley,Event_darkroom5,Oh! I thought you knew.# #This room's for developing photos.
Haley,Event_darkroom6,Is that so...? 
Haley,Event_beach1,"No, you won't! This bracelet was passed down to me by my great-grandmother! "
Haley,Event_beach2, # #...Maybe it'll wash up on another shore. I can't bear to think of it at the bottom of the ocean. 
Haley,Event_room1,"Him? No!# #...Well, I guess I used to like Alex. But not anymore! He's immature."
Haley,Event_room2,"What? That sounds fun, but I wouldn't want to leave Stardew Valley right now..."
Haley,Event_room3,Huh? What's an android?
Haley,summer_Mon,I'm going to get such a nice tan this summer.
Haley,summer_Tue,"Ew, you're all dirty."
Haley,summer_Wed,"Um... Yes?# #I didn't hear you, I'm thinking about something else."
Haley,summer_10,Do you have baby bunnies on your farm? Bunnies are SO cute! <
Haley,summer_Thu,If you stay in the sun a lot it'll make your hair lighter.# #It's a good thing to know!
Haley,summer_Fri,I wonder what Alex is doing today...# #Huh? I didn't notice you standing there.

Haley,summer_Sat_12,Hmm... sounds like a lot of work.
Haley,summer_Sat_13,What? You'd better not be doing that! 
Haley,summer_Sun,Emily usually cooks dinner... But she makes weird stuff like quinoa.
Haley,summer_Tue2,Do you wear those clothes every day?

Haley,summer_Thu6,"If you stay in the sun a lot it will make your hair lighter... But you don't want to get sunburnt, either.# #I just want a healthy amount of sunlight. Everything in moderation, right?"
Haley,summer_Mon6,"I should start reading some books instead of magazines.# #It's good to learn things, isn't it?# #I only ever look at the pictures."
Haley,summer_Sun6,"# HaleySister#I talked to my sister for a while last night. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.# #You know, Emily's not actually that weird. I guess we have more in common than I used to think.# #Don't tell her I said so."

Haley,summer_Tue8,"I guess living in the country isn't so bad.# #If I lived in the city I might start to miss all the trees.# #@, I think I've been hanging out with you too much. "
Haley,summer_Fri10,"Oh, hi @!# #Do you like kids? "
Haley,fall_1,It's fall already? 
Haley,fall_Mon,It's gross when all these fallen leaves get slimy.
Haley,fall_Tue,"Hmm... Something smells weird...# #You've been working on the farm, huh?"
Haley,fall_Wed,"Oh, hi. Did you want something?"
Haley,fall_Thu,I feel the urge to go shopping.

Haley,fall_Sat_13,"Get away from me, you stupid jerk. "
Haley,fall_Sun,I've never been to the forest. It's muddy and I could get a blister on my foot.
Haley,fall_Tue2,"Something smells earthy...# #Oh, right. You work on a farm."
Haley,fall_Fri4,You look like you've been doing a lot of hard work.# #Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Haley,fall_Wed4,"If you're ever bored, come say hi."

Harvey,secondChance_Guys,"I want you back in my life, @. I'm willing to forget what happened. "
Harvey,Mon,We sell a few over-the-counter medicines at the clinic... feel free to stop by if you're feeling exhausted.# #I know that being a farmer is pretty tiring work... don't overdo it!
Harvey,Mon2,"I feel responsible for the health of this whole community... it's kind of stressful.# #It's a pretty small community, and I'm fortunate to be able to build a good relationship with my patients."
Harvey,Mon6,I'd like to stay in Stardew Valley for a while. I'm finally starting to feel involved in the community.# #It feels good to know that you're useful.
Harvey,Mon10,"Oh! Hi, @. # #Do you... have any medical questions? "
Harvey,Tue,"Feel free to stop by my office if you're ever feeling ill.# #You're young, though. You'll probably stay healthy without trying. "
Harvey,Tue8,"Don't overwork yourself, @. Doctor's orders!# #Your health is important to me. "
Harvey,Wed4,"I'd like to get to know you better, @. Let's put aside our doctor-patient relationship."
Harvey,Wed6,It's nice to have a friend in town. 
Harvey,Wed8,You have a really healthy glow. That's good. 
Harvey,Wed,Remember to cover your mouth when you sneeze.# #Then make sure to wash your hands.
Harvey,Thu8,"It's a lot of work, being a doctor. I don't eat as well as I should. # #If I didn't live alone I think it would be easier. "
Harvey,Thu,"Nutrition is important, so make sure and eat well. Try to increase your vegetable intake!# #Home-cooked meals are best. Do you cook?"
Harvey,Fri,"It's a beautiful day, isn't it?# #I wish I had less work to do. "
Harvey,Fri4,"If you want to hang out in my apartment, that's okay with me. I live above the clinic."
Harvey,Fri10,Stop by my place if you ever need a confidential check-up. 
Harvey,Sat,Can I do anything for you?# #Take care.
Harvey,Sat4,"I came here because I liked the small-town atmosphere, and the potential for a holistic approach to patient care.# #I've grown to really love it. "
Harvey,Sat8, ... I'm starting to feel kind of old...# #The older you get the more memories you're burdened with. It can be overwhelming. # #I think I'll stay younger with you around. 
Harvey,Sun,Hmm... I'm struggling to make ends meet. I don't have enough patients.# #I guess I should try to get patients from the neighboring towns...
Harvey,Sun6,"Imagine having a patient's life completely in your hands, and failing to keep them alive... that's something that will haunt you forever. "
Harvey,event_george1,"Thanks, @. # #You see, George, I'm just trying to help you."
Harvey,event_george2," # #Look, George. If you want to behave like this I'm going to have to tell your wife. I don't think she'll be happy."
Harvey,event_aerobics1,"Thanks, @. I appreciate that. "
Harvey,event_aerobics2, ... rude. 
Harvey,event_heart1,"Oh! Hospitals make you nervous, huh?# #Just try and relax. I'm here to help. "
Harvey,event_heart2,Okay. That makes sense.
Harvey,event_heart3,Um. Okay... If you say so. 
Harvey,event_grave1,...You're right.# #...Thanks.
Harvey,event_grave2, 
Harvey,summer_Mon,It's okay to get a moderate amount of sunlight. Just don't get burnt.# #Okay. Take care! Stay healthy.
Harvey,summer_Thu,"Exercise is important, but don't get too exhausted, or you might end up at my clinic!# #Make sure and listen to your body."
Harvey,summer_Fri,"People don't get sick much during the summer. That's nice, but it also means less business for me."
Harvey,fall_Fri,"Have you been going into the mines, @?# #It's a dangerous place. I recommend against it."
Harvey,fall_Sat,When you eat certain foods you'll perform better.# #Eating a 'Farmer's Brunch' will give you the nutrition you need to water and harvest crops better!
Harvey,winter_Wed,"It's flu season, so you'd better be extra careful.# #Make sure to wash your hands often."
Harvey,winter_Sun,"I hate to say this, but I do make a lot more money during flu season.# #I guess if people stopped getting sick, I'd be out of business.# #Don't get the wrong idea! I want people to be healthy... really!"
Leah,Introduction,"Hello, it's nice to meet you. # #You picked a good time to move here... The spring is lovely."
Leah,Resort_Entering,"Don't tell anyone, but Willy let me steer the boat for a few minutes. "
Leah,Resort_Leaving,"Well, that was deeply relaxing."
Leah,Resort,"I love the weather in Stardew Valley, but seeing a different climate now and then helps put things into perspective."
Leah,Resort_Shore,The shape of the waves here is awe inspiring.# #I wonder if I could ever capture that sort of formlessness in a sculpture.
Leah,Resort_Chair,I like the heat as long as I'm keeping perfectly still. 
Leah,Resort_Wander,"Mmm, I bet the trees around here would make for an interesting medium to work with.# #Though Willy probably wouldn't be happy with me if I dragged a bunch of logs onto his ship! "
Leah,Resort_Wander_2,I wonder what kind of things you could forage out here.# #I think I saw some tasty looking walnuts growing on a bush nearby.
Leah,Resort_Bar,Have you tried the Piña Colada? I'm on my second one... hehe.
Leah,danceRejection,I'll be honest. I don't want to dance with you. 
Leah,divorced,I've realized I'm happier by myself. So just leave me be. 
Leah,breakUp,Ohh... Got it. Hah... I really don't have any luck when it comes to this stuff... 
Leah,dumped_Girls,I don't want to see you for a while... 
Leah,secondChance_Girls,You caused a lot of grief with what you did... but I'm ready to put the past behind us. 
Leah,Beach,"I came for the sound of the ocean. Beautiful, isn't it?"
Leah,Mon,"The trees look nice today, don't they?# /211132 Mon_old#So why did you become a farmer?# 21 -5 Mon_21#I want to make tons of money.# 22 5 Mon_22#It's more ""real"" than living in the city.# 211132 5 Mon_211132#To follow in grandpa's footsteps.# 22 5 Mon_22#I wanted to escape my old life."
Leah,Mon_old, 21#So are you making as much money as you hoped?|Spending time in nature is very rewarding.
Leah,Mon_21,"Hmm. That seems kind of shallow, doesn't it? "
Leah,Mon_22,"That's pretty much the reason I came here, too! "
Leah,Mon_211132,That's very sweet to honor your grandfather like that.
Leah,Tue4,"Hi. Oh, you want to talk?# #The landscape around here gives me a lot of ideas. The terrain is almost like a sculpture itself.# #I don't make art for money. It's just an urge that I have.# #Farming seems like a very rewarding profession. You get to create delicious food for everyone! # #You're probably busy. Sorry."
Leah,Tue,"Hello, neighbor.# #We both live outside of town. Does that mean something?"
Leah,Wed,# LeahBug#This morning I accidentally stepped on a bug. # #Sometimes I think it's impossible to live without destroying nature in some way.
Leah,Wed6,"I love being around animals. They're so innocent.# #Farm animals are wonderful, too. "
Leah,Wed8,"Hi @! I was just thinking about you and your farm.# #I was imagining how good it must feel to harvest a big bunch of crops. # #Wouldn't it be nice to have help, though? "
Leah,Thu,"There's actually a lot of wild food in this area, if you know where to look.# #I've been having fresh salads almost every day. "
Leah,Thu6,Foraging is a specialty of mine. Someday I'll make you a fresh salad. 
Leah,Fri,It's simpler to be friends with the trees. They don't have much to say. 
Leah,Fri2,We wouldn't be able to survive without nature. It's good to remember that.
Leah,Fri4,"Hello, @. It's a nice day, isn't it?# #Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to. "
Leah,Sat,I love to decorate for the different seasons.
Leah,Sat8,"Farming sounds so fun. I want to try it, someday. "
Leah,Sun,"If you hear any banging from inside my hut, it's probably just me working on one of my sculptures."
Leah,Sun8,"If you ever find any interesting looking driftwood, I could use it.# #It would be special that you gave it to me. "
Leah,event_sculpt1,"...What? # #Oh! Yeah, that's absolutely right! "
Leah,event_sculpt2,"There's nothing wrong with that... I think there's lots of beauty to be found in raw, untouched nature!# #But as a human, I'm also interested in how we shape and interpret the world around us... I guess what I'm saying is that I'm interested in 'art'."
Leah,event_sculpt3,You pig! ^Oh! You're...? Me too. # #Get out! ^That's good to know. 
Leah,event_parents1,You're right... I just wouldn't have been happy back there. # #It was better for both of us... to end an unsustainable relationship while we were still young and flexible. 
Leah,event_parents2,"That's a little harsh... but, yeah. We had different priorities. "
Leah,event_parents3,"Oh yeah? Well maybe I'll just leave, then! "
Leah,event_parents4, ... # #I guess you're right... it was kind of selfish. But can you really blame me for wanting to be happy? Ugh... I don't know... 
Leah,event_parents5, ... # #Maybe you're right... Humans are selfish creatures. I don't know. # #I probably shouldn't dwell on it. We all have to make hard choices from time to time. 
Leah,summer_1,You can tell it's summer by the sweet smell of nectar wafting through the air! 
Leah,summer_Mon,"I found some wild fruits this morning!# #Sorry, I don't have any left. # #Keep looking, I'm sure you'll find something."
Leah,summer_Tue,"The sound of farm animals is great, isn't it?"
Leah,summer_Tue4,"The simple things in life are best: a soft summer breeze, majestic clouds, and a goblet full of Stardew Valley red."
Leah,summer_Thu6,I have a good eye for wild fruit. Some day I'll make you a nice fruit salad. 
Leah,summer_Fri,"You can use a tapper to harvest syrups and other useful liquids directly from trees.# #It's a slow process, but the result can be quite valuable."
Leah,summer_Fri2,"I hate to be blunt, but if we don't treat nature with respect, our grandchildren will be doomed.# #Don't you think so?"
Leah,summer_Fri6,"Hello, @. Do you ever get lonely on that big farm?# #Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to. "
Leah,summer_Sat,The flowing water keeps my house a little bit cooler in summer.# #I can't tolerate heat very well.
Leah,summer_Sun,"What should I do on such a warm, lazy day? # #Any ideas?"
Leah,fall_1,How quickly the seasons change!# #It's shocking.
Leah,fall_Mon,# .5#I found some wild mushrooms over the weekend!# #I had a huge plate of wild mushrooms and eggs for breakfast today... I'm still full.# #Keep your nose to the ground and you'll find some mushrooms yourself... I'm sure of it.
Leah,fall_Tue,I wonder if I could make a collage out of dried leaves?# #They're just so colorful... I can't help but think of the potential for art projects. 
Leah,fall_Tue4,"Everyone has a unique and interesting perspective, whether they believe it or not. Don't you think so?# #Although, some people have opinions that I just can't respect."
Leah,fall_Wed,It's so nice to live by the river.# #I fall asleep to the soothing sound of water every night.
Leah,fall_Thu6,One of these days I'll have to make you a wild mushroom stir-fry. 
Leah,fall_Fri,"Do you have a kitchen in your house?# #If you have a kitchen, you can cook all kinds of delicious meals. "
Leah,fall_Fri6,Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to. 
Leah,fall_Sat,Decorations accentuate the feeling of the season. I think it's a worthwhile tradition.
Leah,fall_Sun,There's a lot of good places to walk around here.# #It feels good to stretch your legs.
Leah,winter_Mon,I love the way everything looks when it's covered with fresh snow.
Leah,winter_Tue,"It gets pretty cold in my little cabin. # #I just snuggle up under a huge blanket, and I'm okay. "
Leah,winter_Wed,"I saw a snow rabbit early this morning! They're rare, aren't they?"
Leah,winter_Thu,I'm having a hard time finding fresh food to eat.# #I've been eating a lot of bread. 
Leah,winter_Thu6," ... It's hard to get fresh food in the winter.# #I bet your farm is pretty well stocked with food, huh?"
Leah,winter_Fri,"Time seems to move slower here.# #When I lived in the city, the year went by so fast."
Leah,winter_Fri6,Do you ever get cold in that farmhouse of yours?# #Stop by my cabin if you want to huddle under one of my quilts and drink cider. 
Leah,winter_Sat,Hello. Do you want something?
Leah,winter_Sat2,"Hello, @. Is there something you wanted to talk about?"
Leah,winter_Sun,Do you ever take a whole day off?# #It's a refreshing break.
Abigail,Rainy_Day_0,The dark... the rain... it gets me excited. 
Abigail,Rainy_Day_1,"Hey, remember when we played that duet by the lake? This weather reminds me of that day.# #You really surprised me with that mini-harp... I never expected that. I guess that's why I like you so much. "
Abigail,Rainy_Day_2,Hey! I woke up early and did some exploring on my own. I found this and it reminded me of you. [768 767 769 66 82]# #Think you can find something better than that? I'm not so sure! 
Abigail,Rainy_Day_3,"It might be a good day to visit the caves, huh? Just be careful out there.# #If you go, bring a Life Elixir or two."
Abigail,Rainy_Day_4,Maybe I'll boot up Journey Of The Prairie King today... one of these days I swear I'll beat it on my own. 
Abigail,patio_Abigail, is lost in her music.
Abigail,Rainy_Day_Abigail,"The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?"
Abigail,Rainy_Night_0,I was just gazing out into the rainswept woods... I swear I saw something darker than black shifting around the trees. 
Abigail,Rainy_Night_1,It's a good night to see a ghost...
Abigail,Rainy_Night_2,Can you feel it? There's a stillness in the rain...
Abigail,Rainy_Night_3,"On nights like this, I like to turn the light down low and just listen... "
Abigail,Rainy_Night_4,I felt like making some soup for dinner. I hope it's not too disgusting. [199 218 219 727 730] 
Abigail,Rainy_Night_5,Hey! You look like you've been hard at work. Can I help you relax?^Have you been working hard? You look cute when you're a little exhausted. 
Abigail,Rainy_Night_Abigail,The sound of rain should put us right to sleep tonight.
Abigail,Indoor_Day_0,"I always loved this place, long before you moved in. Now I can explore the farm whenever I want! "
Abigail,Indoor_Day_1,"Hey, @. Heading out into the wild? I got you something...[286 287 205 732]# #Use that if you get into a tough spot. It should help keep you safe."
Abigail,Indoor_Day_2,"Heading to the mines? Hey... if you find something tasty, remember to bring me a piece! "
Abigail,Indoor_Day_3,Hey! I'm just debating what I should do today. I'm not used to having this much freedom!
Abigail,Indoor_Day_4,"You don't mind if I do some re-decorating now and then, do you? I'm still excited to have a place of my own to work on."
Abigail,Indoor_Day_Abigail,There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it.
Abigail,Indoor_Night_0,"I had a good day, today. There's always something interesting goin on around here, if you look close enough."
Abigail,Indoor_Night_1,Hey! Tell me about your day. Did anything exciting happen? 
Abigail,Indoor_Night_2,"I used to be a night owl, but I'm starting to enjoy the rhythm of life on the farm. It feels natural."
Abigail,Indoor_Night_3, ... I'm ready to call it a night pretty soon. 
Abigail,Indoor_Night_4,The sounds of the night are louder out here. I'll never stop enjoying that.
Abigail,Indoor_Night_Abigail,Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us... 
Abigail,Outdoor_0,The soft breeze is blowing mountain air throughout the valley today. It smells like fresh pine and sage.
Abigail,Outdoor_1,Hmm... I think we've got plenty of space for outdoor slime ranching!
Abigail,Outdoor_2,"Make sure to keep things tidy around your Grandpa's shrine. There's something special about it, I can feel it."
Abigail,Outdoor_3,It's pretty cool that we have a cave on our property. It's something I always dreamed about. 
Abigail,Outdoor_4,I always forget to put some snacks in my pocket. 
Abigail,Outdoor_Abigail,"I'm just going to hang out here, okay?# #There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. "
Abigail,funLeave_Abigail,"I'm going in to town today, just so you know. I need to stretch these legs a bit."
Abigail,funReturn_Abigail,Hey! Did you have a good day? Mine went well. It was refreshing to take a walk. 
Abigail,OneKid_3,"I can't believe I'm a ""mom""... life is weird. "
Abigail,TwoKids_0,I already gave and their chocolate cereal. They were screaming!
Abigail,TwoKids_2,I had a dream that will grow up to be a famous monster hunter. I've already been thinking about a little armor set.
Abigail,TwoKids_3,"A cool old house, a couple kids, and an amazing farm. I never thought I'd come this far... but, hey! Our lives are just getting started. "
Abigail,Good_1,Did you hear that? Sometimes I'm convinced this house is haunted. 
Abigail,Good_2,Welwick's horoscope predicted great things for me today. I feel really motivated!
Abigail,Good_3,"I can't even remember the last time I dyed my hair... I swear, it never fades from this color..."
Abigail,Good_4,I'm glad I owned a heavy pair of boots before moving in. It's hard to imagine tip-toeing around the mud in sneakers. 
Abigail,Good_5,I was just admiring the mermaid's pendant you gave me... I'll proudly wear this to my grave. 
Abigail,Good_6,"Hey. I know you're smart, but I still worry about you sometimes. The world is full of monsters. # #Just promise me you'll be careful. I don't want to lose you."
Abigail,Good_7,@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for us. I'm really proud of you. 
Abigail,Neutral_0,I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and shriveled. It's going to happen some day!
Abigail,Neutral_1,Do you think your Grandpa would be proud of us?
Abigail,Neutral_6,I wonder how the old shop is doing? I should visit my parents again soon.
Abigail,Neutral_7,"If you moved on to the spirit world, I'd set up a little shrine for you next to Grandpa's."
Abigail,Neutral_8,"No matter how much we clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.# #I guess farms are kind of dirty."
Abigail,Neutral_9,I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? I might get bored.
Abigail,Bad_7,"I used to be special to you, your best friend... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner. "
Abigail,Bad_8,You've been so cold to me lately... What's wrong with you? You're acting like a bog spirit... 
Abigail,Bad_9,I wonder if I could've done better... I was very good friends with Sebastian before we met. He was probably the one... 
Abigail,spring_1,"So, do you have any big plans for the new year?"
Abigail,spring_12,"Hey, the egg festival is tomorrow. I'm sorry, but I won't go easy on you because we're married! # #I plan on winning that egg hunt. Go ahead and try to beat me."
Abigail,spring_2,Do you have any new year's resolutions? I'm trying to lose a few pounds around the middle. 
Abigail,summer_1,"I get sunburnt very easily, so I need to be careful this time of year.# #I hope you like me pale! "
Abigail,summer_4,"Make sure you don't get a heat stroke, my love.# #Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself."
Abigail,summer_8,Sorry about the smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.
Abigail,summer_15,"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.# #Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's fun! "
Abigail,fall_6,"Ah... fall. This might be my favorite time of year. The colors really complement my hair, don't you think?"
Abigail,fall_1,"The scent is unmistakable... mushroom, rotting leaves, pumpkin. It's fall, alright. Isn't it lovely?"
Abigail,fall_2,"Can we grow giant pumpkins this season? Please, honey? "
Abigail,fall_20,"Honey... you're worth more to me than a chest full of quartz.# #Now, a chest full of amethyst? Hmm... I'd have to think about that one. "
Abigail,winter_3,I actually like the cold weather. It just gives me an excuse to get cozy! 
Abigail,winter_15,It's fun to explore the valley in winter! Everything is so different under a blanket of snow. And so quiet...
Abigail,spring_Abigail,"I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive."
Abigail,summer_Abigail,Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake.
Abigail,fall_Abigail,Do I smell pumpkin on you? Maybe I'm just dreaming... 
Abigail,winter_Abigail,"Remember when we played 'Prairie King' together in my room, so long ago? Those were good times. "
Abigail,spouseRoom_Abigail,# .5#I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.# #I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell.
Alex,Rainy_Day_0,"With all this space, I can really achieve a full body workout."
Alex,Rainy_Day_1,I never had many friends in town... I sometimes wonder how I'd end up if you never moved here. 
Alex,Rainy_Day_2,Aw... I was gonna do some jogging outside. But I can't really do it in this weather.
Alex,Rainy_Day_3, ... I just woke up and I'm hungry for some protein. 
Alex,Rainy_Day_4,I think I might start reading books. I don't want to become stagnant now that I'm a married guy!
Alex,patio_Alex,Unghh... one... Unghhh... two... It feels great to lift weights outdoors! 
Alex,Rainy_Night_0,"Hey, did you have a good day? I'm sure tomorrow will be even better. "
Alex,Rainy_Night_1,How's it going? I've been carrying the old gridball around with me all day. A guy can pretend... 
Alex,Rainy_Night_2,Oh... the smell? I've been eating garlic all day. I'm trying to stay manly... Sorry. 
Alex,Rainy_Night_3,I've been setting aside a few scraps for Dusty. He deserves a treat now and then.
Alex,Rainy_Night_4,"I was hungry so I made some dinner. Here, I saved you a plate. [241 242 225 214 198] "

Alex,Indoor_Day_2,Come here. ... Mmhmm. You're firming up from all that farm work.
Alex,Indoor_Day_3,"I'm still getting used to cooking and doing laundry... It's not exactly my favorite, but I knew what I was getting into when I married you. "
Alex,Indoor_Day_4,"There's a couple things around the house that I'm going to try and fix today. Don't worry about me, I'm not bored."
Alex,Indoor_Night_0,"It feels good to push yourself to the limit, doesn't it? You'll really feel like you earned your place in the soft bed tonight."
Alex,Indoor_Night_1,Did you get a haircut or something? You're looking pretty good today. Maybe it's all that fresh air... 
Alex,Indoor_Night_2,Tell me all about your day. It's good to get everything off your chest now and then.
Alex,Indoor_Night_3,Hey... I got some new shorts. I thought you might be interested to know... 
Alex,Indoor_Night_4,"If you need some quiet time to yourself, that's okay with me."
Alex,Outdoor_0,Hey. When I stand here and look out over our land... I'm really proud. You've done great work.
Alex,Outdoor_1,This is a great place to raise children. I would've loved growing up in a place like this. So much room to run around!
Alex,Outdoor_2,I like to spend as much time outside as possible. It just feels better to be out here.
Alex,Outdoor_3,"Look at us, with our little farm. We make a cute couple. ^Hey. Maybe it's the golden light, but you look beautiful today. "
Alex,Outdoor_4,Ahh... It feels great to be outside. Stardew Valley really is the most beautiful place...
Alex,OneKid_0,I'm still getting used to my new life as a stay-at-home dad. 
Alex,OneKid_1,"Little is going to grow up strong, just like Daddy."
Alex,OneKid_3,I wonder what it's like to be pregnant...? 
Alex,TwoKids_2,Maybe will be the first professional gridball player from Pelican Town? 
Alex,TwoKids_3,I finally have the family life that I missed out on as a kid... thank you. 
Alex,Good_0,@... I will always love you. 
Alex,Good_1,You're very handsome... have I told you that? ^You're very beautiful... have I told you that? 
Alex,Good_6,"I know you're strong, but sometimes I worry that you might get eaten by slimes... or worse. Just be careful. "
Alex,funLeave_Alex,I'm going into town today. I'll see you tonight.
Alex,funReturn_Alex,"I had a good day. I like to see my grandparents often, they're getting pretty old."
Alex,spring_1,"Finally, the snow has melted and the sun is back! My body feels great. "
Alex,spring_6,I wonder if a powder of stardrop would help me bulk up...
Alex,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? I guess it'll be good to load up on the free eggs.
Alex,spring_23,"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I better do some extra push-ups tonight. # #Those jumpsuits are pretty tight... and everyone's going to be watching closely."
Alex,summer_1,"Summer's a very energetic time of year, and body feels it too! I feel solid."
Alex,summer_10,Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?# #I have no idea what's good... you're the chef! 
Alex,summer_27,Aw... summer's almost gone. My muscles are starting to deflate... 
Alex,fall_1,"Well, summer's over... but I'm going to stay positive. The warmer seasons will always return."
Alex,fall_15,"Tomorrow's the fair, are we going to go?# #I don't care one way or another."
Alex,fall_26,I hope my grandparents are doing okay. Grandpa's too cheap to turn on the furnace until the last minute.
Alex,winter_1,Make sure you stay warm this winter. I worry about your delicate skin.
Alex,winter_7,Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow? I think you can win it!
Alex,winter_28,"It's been a great year, @. I'm looking forward to next year! Now, come closer... "
Elliott,Rainy_Day_0,I feel inspired today... I think I'll do some writing.
Elliott,Rainy_Day_1,"The sound of rain, in some tiny way, reminds me of my cabin by the beach.# #The farm is wonderful, but I do miss the sound of the ocean."
Elliott,Rainy_Day_2,I got up early and made coffee.[395]# #I find that a cup of this exquisite brew makes the early morning a lot more pleasant.
Elliott,Rainy_Day_3,"I think I'll remain indoors today, my dear. The rain causes my hair to go limp."
Elliott,Rainy_Day_4,My inspiration for writing is like the weather... it comes and goes at random. Today I feel entirely dull. # #Perhaps I'll read one of the classics to get my creative juices flowing.
Elliott,patio_Elliott,"Ah, what a lovely day to read a book... don't you think, my dear?"
Elliott,Rainy_Night_0,"Good evening. Did you have a productive day, @?^Good evening. Did you have a productive day, my dear?"

Elliott,Rainy_Night_3,What did I do today? I'll just say this... it takes a lot of work to maintain this rugged physique!
Elliott,Rainy_Night_4,I spent the afternoon daydreaming about the ocean. So I decided to cook some seafood. [198 202 727 728] 
Elliott,Indoor_Day_0,I've been taking much better care of myself now that we're together. The bachelor life wasn't particularly healthy for me.
Elliott,Indoor_Day_1,"Good morning, @! I made us a pot of coffee.[395]# #I find myself craving this robust flavor nearly every morning."
Elliott,Indoor_Day_2,"If you find a spider in the house, don't squash it! Just let me know and I'll take the poor thing outside."

Elliott,Indoor_Night_1,A crackling fire adds wonderful ambience to the house... every piece of wood burns in a unique way.
Elliott,Indoor_Night_2,"I never had much success growing plant in my old beach house. Hopefully I can pick up a thing or two by watching you.# #In this respect, you are the master and I only a humble apprentice."
Elliott,Indoor_Night_3,"When I behold thy wondrous face, a precious jewel of form and grace, my heart... torn by the dread of night, is purified with golden light.# #Poetry is the only way I can begin to describe my feelings for you. "
Elliott,Indoor_Night_4,"My love... I wouldn't trade you for 100 iridium bars.# #Nor 1000...# #Not even 10,000 bars, no. # #... # #No, not even 100,000 bars! # #... # #Wa... one million bars of pure iridium...? Don't make me do this... "
Elliott,Outdoor_0,My wildest dreams have come true... just look at this incredible landscape!
Elliott,Outdoor_1,"Fertile soil beneath my feet, fresh air to fill my lungs, and the sun's warmth to delight my skin... Life is going well."
Elliott,Outdoor_2,I might stay here and write some poetry. I'm feeling a sudden surge of creativity! You go on ahead and take care of business.
Elliott,Outdoor_3,"If I stay perfectly still, perhaps a resplendent butterfly will bless my nose with a landing."
Elliott,Outdoor_4,I drank too much coffee... my mouth feels about as dry as the Calico Desert. # #Oh... sorry about the coffee breath.

Elliott,Good_0,@... I'm so proud of all your hard work. I'm very lucky to have you. 
Elliott,Good_1,I made a whole secret book of poems expressing my love for you. 
Elliott,Good_2,I came to the valley to find the ivory tower from which my talents could reign supreme. But what I really found was a dungeon of loneliness. You saved me from that. 
Elliott,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave? Your jawline is perfect. ^Your feminine allure is irresistible today. I can't keep my eyes off you. "
Elliott,Good_4,"I feel burnt out in your absence. But when I hear that sound of muddy boots on wood, my heart rises from the ash."
Elliott,Good_5,I'm doing a walking meditation. It's good for creativity.
Elliott,Good_6,Be careful out there! I do worry about you sometimes. There are people in the world who would take advantage of you.
Elliott,funLeave_Elliott,I think I'll walk down to the beach today. It's always nice to see the ocean again.

Elliott,fall_1,The splendor of fall... a verdant banquet for all the senses to enjoy... has inspired some of the greatest poetry of all time.
Elliott,fall_15,"I might set my pride aside and sink my eager teeth into a sloppy, saucy barbecue sandwich tomorrow."
Elliott,fall_26,Would you still love me if I guzzled two gallons of pumpkin ale at the Spirit's Eve festival? Sometimes a man has primitive urges...
Elliott,winter_1,Winter is a great time to read books and play the piano. Remember to pause and enjoy a quiet moment or two.
Elliott,winter_7,"I'm a little out of practice, but I plan on entering the fishing contest tomorrow! You've got some stiff competition, dear."
Elliott,winter_28,"Happy new year's eve, my dear. Please accept this to celebrate. [348]"
Emily,Rainy_Day_0,I wonder where the flying insects go when it rains? Don't they get hit by the raindrops?
Emily,Rainy_Day_1,A day like this is a blessing from mother nature.
Emily,Rainy_Day_2,"Good morning... I got this gift for you. Don't worry, I already purified it with sage incense. [428 440 444 338 207]"
Emily,Rainy_Day_3,"I meant to let the parrot go free, but his wing never fully healed. He seems content, though. I give him lots of attention.# #He told me that he's happy here."

Emily,Rainy_Night_0,"Every moment has a unique and precious beauty... do you notice? It can be easy to forget, sometimes."

Emily,Rainy_Night_1,I can hear the plants talking to each other... they're so happy after today's rain!
Emily,Rainy_Night_2,"How was your day, @? You look a little soggy."
Emily,Rainy_Night_3,My day was very peaceful. How was yours?
Emily,Rainy_Night_4,"Want some dessert? It's my special raw, gluten-free version, sweetened only with cactus syrup.[232 234 223 220] "
Emily,Rainy_Night_5,Does the sound of rain ever put you in a trance?
Emily,Indoor_Day_0,Another beautiful day on farm... I have faith that something good will happen today! 
Emily,Indoor_Day_1,"Here, take this. It's for you. [428 440 444 338 207 395 749]"
Emily,Indoor_Day_2,"Hey, someone must've gotten a good night of sleep... you look fresh this morning. "

Emily,Indoor_Night_2,"Is it bed time already? My, the day just floated away from me again. "
Emily,Indoor_Night_3,"Ah, that aroma! It can only be you. # #It's a good smell."
Emily,Indoor_Night_4,"I swept the whole house, washed the windows, dusted, and cleaned the fridge. It was a very productive day!"
Emily,Outdoor_0,I love getting up early. There's a certain freshness to the air and the wildlife is much more active.
Emily,Outdoor_1,"What's on the agenda today, dear?"
Emily,Outdoor_2,Oooh! Ooh! I saw another one! # #I'm counting squirrels.
Emily,Outdoor_3,"A little sunlight is good for you. Just don't get crispy, okay?"
Emily,Outdoor_4,"Good morning! I was wondering when you'd finally roll out of bed! # #It's okay, @... you deserve a good night of rest."
Emily,OneKid_0,I hope we can raise to be kind and considerate. That's more important than getting A's in school.
Emily,OneKid_1,"Is one child enough, or should we raise another?# #I guess we'll just see where fate leads us."
Emily,OneKid_3,I lit a pale green candle and shook a sprig of baby-mint over . That should ward off any dangerous spirits.
Emily,TwoKids_1,"A big house, two kids and a parrot... I have my hands full!"
Emily,TwoKids_2,"Well, certainly has your hair... "
Emily,TwoKids_3,"Oh, I already fed the kids their organic quinoa puffs with goat milk. You just focus on the farm!"
Emily,Good_1,This is so fun to live together! I always thought I'd be single my whole life.
Emily,Good_2,It was our destiny to be together... I believe that with all my heart!
Emily,Good_3,Thanks for taking me into your home. I love this new life. 
Emily,Good_4,Our vibrational energies are perfectly in tune. Can't you feel it?
Emily,Good_5,I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is beautiful! I can feel the pure blue energy radiating from it. 
Emily,Good_6,"I had another dream about us last night. We had climbed to the top of a crystal tree, looking down on the most lush and beautiful meadow. I keep having this dream.# #I don't know what it means, but I feel that it's a good omen."
Emily,Neutral_0,"I hope you'll still like me when I grow old and my hair turns to a dull, faded steel."
Emily,Neutral_8,I feel uninspired today. 
Emily,funLeave_Emily,"I'm going to visit town today, and later on I'm going to help out at the saloon. Have a nice day."
Emily,funReturn_Emily,My day went well... it's good to get out of the house now and then.
Emily,spring_2,"My friends, the plants, have come back to life. I feel content."
Emily,spring_1,"Happy new year, honey. Let's make this a special one. "
Emily,spring_22,Hmm... I'm thinking maybe a salad of fresh foraged greens for dinner tonight?
Emily,summer_20,The energy in our bodies fluctuate just as the seasons do. Understanding your own unique rhythym is the first step to inner harmony.
Emily,summer_2,May Yoba bless you on this lovely day. 
Emily,fall_1,The year's already half-way over. Can you believe it?
Emily,fall_25,"Our bodies are naturally in tune with the seasons. This light and color of fall compels us to prepare for the barren winter.# #To our distant ancestors, this feeling was encompassing and vital. For us, it only barely peeks through the noise of modern life."
Emily,winter_15,"On a day like this, I have a craving for cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom."
Emily,winter_5, ... Why does there have to be war and hatred in the world? 
Emily,winter_2,"I can't help but think of all the poor, frozen squirrels out there right now. "
Emily,spring_Maru,"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @! "
Emily,fall_Emily,I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing! 
Emily,summer_Emily,"Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it?# #Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today."
Emily,winter_Emily,"Whoops, my hair is frozen solid again. "
Emily,spouseRoom_Emily,I'm going to spend some time with the parrot today. It breaks my heart that he'll never fly again. 
Haley,Rainy_Day_0,"I've changed a lot over the years, but I still prefer sunny weather."
Haley,Rainy_Day_1,"Sometimes I daydream about our retirement... relaxing on the sunny beaches of the Fern Islands!# #Do you ever think about the future, @?"
Haley,Rainy_Day_2,"Good morning! I got up early and baked something sweet for you! [223 234 211 651 731]# #I know you're strong, but you still need to eat well to stay at your best! "
Haley,Rainy_Day_3,"I can't go outside today... my hair will go limp. Forgive me, dear. # #I want to look my best for you."
Haley,Rainy_Day_4,"Are you going out in this weather? Just make sure to wipe your boots on the way back in, honey.# #I'll just stay here and do some housework."
Haley,patio_Haley,Say 'goat cheese'!
Haley,Rainy_Day_Haley,Oh no... If this weather keeps up I'll get so pale. 
Haley,Rainy_Night_0,"Oh, I'm glad you're back. It's so cold in here by myself... Are you almost ready to shut off the lights?"
Haley,Rainy_Night_1,I hope it's nice and sunny tomorrow morning. Too much rain can make me moody. 
Haley,Rainy_Night_2,I hope Emily isn't too lonely all by herself. I should visit her again soon. 
Haley,Rainy_Night_3,"Rain is horrible for a photographer. The lighting is awful, and you can't go outside without ruining your equipment! "
Haley,Rainy_Night_4,"I made a hot meal for you, honey. Lots of spice, just how you like it. Enjoy! [727 231 207 199] "
Haley,Rainy_Night_5,"I never thought I'd say this, but the country lifestyle really suits me. "
Haley,Rainy_Night_Haley,"Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely. "
Haley,Indoor_Day_0,Good morning! Did you sleep well? # #I think I might break out the old camera today... the lighting is just perfect.
Haley,Indoor_Day_1,"Good morning, dear! Smells good, doesn't it? I made you breakfast! [194 195 210 211 216]# #I know you're busy with your work. I'm here to support you in any way I can!"
Haley,Indoor_Day_2,Did you sleep okay? You were snoring a little. # #I've got some chores to do in here. Have a good day.
Haley,Indoor_Day_3,I'm glad I've learned to enjoy cleaning! The house gets dirty very easily. 0# #It's satisfying to get everything squeaky clean.# #Can I have a kiss before you leave? 1
Haley,Indoor_Day_4,"Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh?# #I'll be thinking of you. < "
Haley,Indoor_Day_Haley,I felt like I had no direction in life before I met you. Now I have exactly what I want. 
Haley,Indoor_Night_Haley,"You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress. "
Haley,Outdoor_0,"I always feel best when I'm outside, breathing fresh air.# #Don't get me wrong, your grandpa's old cottage is very nice! But nothing beats this beautiful landscape."
Haley,Outdoor_1,"We've got to make sure the farm is cute! That might be important... right, honey?"
Haley,Outdoor_2,"Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!# #I'll be thinking of you. "
Haley,Outdoor_3,"I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right?# # ... it's hot out here."
Haley,Outdoor_4,"Don't overwork yourself, dear.# #Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat. "
Haley,Outdoor_Haley,"Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?"
Haley,funLeave_Haley,I'm going to socialize in town for a bit today.
Haley,funReturn_Haley,"It was nice seeing everyone in town. Did you have a good day, dear?"
Haley,OneKid_3,Isn't it strange? I'm not used to being a mother.
Haley,TwoKids_2,Isn't a very good-looking baby?
Haley,TwoKids_3,"A big house, two kids, and a beautiful plot of land. I'm not sure what else I could ask for."
Haley,spring_2,"So, what are we planting this season?"
Haley,spring_1,"Now that winter's over, we've got lots of sunny weather to look forward to. I'm excited."
Haley,summer_3,Sorry if I don't look my best... the air is just so humid that my hair doesn't hold up too well.
Haley,summer_15,It's summer... that means the house is full of flies and ants... yuck. 
Haley,fall_2,I already miss summer...
Haley,fall_1,Fall is kind of sad for me... everything is dying. 
Haley,winter_14,My skin feels so dry in this weather.
Haley,winter_2,"For some reason, the snowy weather gives me cravings for pink cake..."
Haley,spring_Haley,"Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now."
Haley,summer_Haley,I love watching the fireflies on a hot summer's night. It's the closest I'll ever come to visiting the stars.
Haley,fall_Haley,"Even though I prefer summer, fall might be the best season to take pictures. Those long, low shadows..."
Haley,winter_Haley,I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles. Remember that? # #We've come a long way since then. 
Harvey,Rainy_Day_0,"It's a myth that rainy weather causes the flu. However, take care that you don't slip on the mud!# #I often worry about you."
Harvey,Rainy_Day_1,It was so incredibly lonely living above the clinic by myself... I'm much happier now. 
Harvey,Rainy_Day_2,"I woke up early, but I made sure not to wake you. You looked so peaceful."
Harvey,Rainy_Day_3,"I don't mind the rain. Sure, I can't watch the planes go by, but I can still listen to the radio chatter.# #It makes the whole thing a little more mysterious."
Harvey,Rainy_Day_4,I have a backlog of house chores I want to complete today. I've got plenty to keep me busy!
Harvey,Rainy_Night_0,"How was your day, honey? I was going to do the dishes but I got absorbed in the latest issue of ""Knee Surgery Enthusiast""."
Harvey,patio_Harvey,"You know, this 'journal of tendon dynamics' is actually bearable when I'm reading out here."
Harvey,Rainy_Night_1,"If you're enjoying life, who cares if it's a little repetitive? That's what I say."
Harvey,Rainy_Night_2,"You look a little soggy, hun. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?^You look a little soggy, dear. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?"
Harvey,Rainy_Night_3,"The sound of rain gives our minds something to focus on, so we're not distracted by random thoughts.# #That's my theory for why it's so soothing..."
Harvey,Rainy_Night_4,"I made us a nice healthy dinner. Only fresh, wholesome ingredients from the valley! [212 214 225 209 200] # #Just make sure to eat a reasonable portion, dear."
Harvey,Indoor_Day_0,"I think we're all striving to reach some kind of balance in life. An equilibrium of complexity.# #For me, moving here was exactly what my body needed to find that balance. "
Harvey,Indoor_Day_1,"Good morning, @! I made you a nutritious breakfast.[201]# #Eggs are a good source of essential nutrients, so eat up."
Harvey,Indoor_Day_2,I'm going to study the medical literature today. It's important for me to keep up-to-date so I can give my patients the best care possible!
Harvey,Indoor_Day_3,I'm going to listen to some jazz music and finalize my medical reports today. What do you have planned?
Harvey,Indoor_Day_4,I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far. 
Harvey,Indoor_Night_0,"You look exhausted, dear. Let me give you a massage tonight. I promise it will reduce the inflammation in your muscle tissue! "
Harvey,Indoor_Night_1,"I took it easy today... spent some time reading books, fiddled with my radio, and worked on a model airplane.# #It's important to take a day off now and then to relax... stress is unhealthy."
Harvey,Indoor_Night_2,Good evening... did you finish everything you needed to do today?# #Don't worry about me. I'm very self-sufficient. If you have more work to do go right ahead.
Harvey,Indoor_Night_3,"It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as Farm."
Harvey,Indoor_Night_4,Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem.
Harvey,Outdoor_0,"This is a very safe spot. You go on ahead and take care of business, don't worry about me."
Harvey,Outdoor_1,"I believe this must be the ideal place to raise children, scientifically. What do you think?"
Harvey,Outdoor_2,"I may not be the most exciting guy, but I'll stay loyal to you for the rest of my life. "
Harvey,Outdoor_3,@... you... you mean the world to me. 
Harvey,Outdoor_4,As a scientist I'm fascinated by the delicate interplay of insect and plant life.
Harvey,OneKid_0,You and are the most important parts of my life.
Harvey,OneKid_1,Little is going to have the perfect childhood here. We're really fortunate to have this opportunity.
Harvey,OneKid_3,"So far, I really like being a father! "
Harvey,TwoKids_0,I already gave and their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!
Harvey,TwoKids_1,I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once.
Harvey,TwoKids_2,"Maybe will grow up to become a pilot, like I never could?"
Harvey,TwoKids_3,"My life is devoted to you and the children now, and I'm very happy about it. I always dreamed of having a wonderful family. # #I had nightmares of being a bachelor forever.... I love you so much. "
Harvey,Good_0,@...I still can't believe we're married... 
Harvey,Good_1,"You rescued me from a life of loneliness, and filled the emptiness in my heart. Thank you. "
Harvey,Good_2,I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here... ^I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here... 
Harvey,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave? ^Oh, my... you look beautiful today. "
Harvey,Good_6,Be careful out there! I have nightmares about your limp body being wheeled into the emergency room. 
Harvey,funLeave_Harvey,I think I'll take a little walk today. I need to unwind.
Harvey,funReturn_Harvey,"I had a nice day. It's refreshing to spend some time alone now and then. Did you have a good day, honey?"
Harvey,spring_1,It's wonderful to see all the plants return to life. The greenery is refreshing after a monochrome winter.
Harvey,spring_12,"Oh, it's a festival tomorrow, isn't it? Large crowds, activities... "
Harvey,spring_23,W...Will you dance with me at the festival tomorrow? # #It's always a little embarrassing. 
Harvey,summer_1,"Make sure you don't get sunburnt, dear! It's very dangerous for your skin. # #As your husband and doctor, I consider your health and safety my top priority!"
Harvey,summer_10,Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?# #I would put an item of high value and quality. We all want to leave a great impression on the governor!
Harvey,summer_27,"As summer draws to a close, and the colder season begins, my workload tends to increase. Sorry in advance if I'm a little moody..."
Harvey,fall_1,"Make sure and diversify your harvests this fall, my dear.# #Or just grow cranberries... It's really up to you. What do I know?"
Harvey,fall_15,"Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while. "
Harvey,fall_26,"I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave."
Harvey,winter_1,"The air is very dry during winter. That's why our skin tends to become irritated.# #Don't worry, I'll rub a little truffle oil onto your back every night. "
Harvey,winter_7,Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? I do enjoy the igloos...
Harvey,winter_28,"Well, here's to a fantastic year. I have complete confidence that next year will be even better! "
Leah,Rainy_Day_0,I sometimes find inspiration in the most unlikely of places.
Leah,Rainy_Day_1,I used to find rain depressing when I lived in the city. But here in Stardew Valley it's beautiful.
Leah,Rainy_Day_2,"Good morning! I got up early and did some mushroom hunting. Here, take one.[281 404 420 257]# #Searching for mushrooms is like going on a treasure hunt. It's a lot of fun. "

Leah,Rainy_Night_0,How was your day? Did you see any animals out there?
Leah,patio_Leah,"Don't look too close, it's a work in progress."
Leah,Rainy_Night_1,I usually go for salad... but a wet night like this gives me cravings for hot soup. 
Leah,Rainy_Night_2,It's going to be relaxing to fall asleep on a night like this... 
Leah,Rainy_Night_3,"I made a little wood sculpture today, but it was so ugly I threw it into the fire. # #I think to become a great artist, you have to be critical of your own work."

Leah,Indoor_Day_4,"Good morning, @! I made us some coffee.[395] # #My morning just wouldn't be complete without a hot cup of coffee."

Leah,Indoor_Night_3,"I never thought I'd receive a mermaid's pendant so soon after moving here! I'm happy about it, though. "
Leah,Indoor_Night_4,I saw a wild rabbit today. I just wish I could pet one someday. They look so soft...
Leah,Outdoor_0,The cool breeze feels nice. It reminds me of living by the river.
Leah,Outdoor_1,Hmm... I'm going to do some maintenance over here. I just get the urge to do some hammering now and then.
Leah,Outdoor_2,"It's going to be a special day, I can sense it."
Leah,Outdoor_3,Ah... that smell of fresh dirt. There's nothing quite like it. # #You can just tell the air is clean here... it feels good in the lungs.

Leah,Neutral_6,I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?
Leah,Neutral_7,I don't really feel like doing anything today.
Leah,Neutral_8,"No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.# #I guess farms can be kind of dirty."
Leah,Neutral_9,I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?
Leah,Bad_0,...Do you still love me? 
Leah,Bad_1, ... Maybe we got married too young. 
Leah,Bad_2,Are you still happy with me?s
Leah,Bad_3,Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately. 
Leah,Bad_4,Do you ever wonder what else is out there? 
Leah,Bad_5,You used to be romantic... what happened? # #I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for? 
Leah,Bad_6,We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it? 
Leah,Bad_7,I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner. 
Leah,Bad_8,You've been so cold to me lately... 
Leah,Bad_9,I wonder if I could've done better. 
Leah,spring_2,"So, what are we planting this season?"
Leah,spring_1,That was some way to ring in the new year last night... 
Leah,spring_15, ... I guess it's time for the 'spring cleaning' again. 
Leah,summer_1,"Ah, summer... I can smell the spice berries already. "
Leah,summer_9,Sorry if I'm wet to the touch... I was sweating all night in the heat.
Leah,summer_2,"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.# #Don't worry, I'll take care of them."
Leah,fall_1,I love fall for the mushroom hunting opportunities. It comes and goes pretty fast.
Leah,fall_20,Have you planned for winter at all? It's good to have a stockpile of hay.
Leah,fall_2,I know harvest season is a busy time for you. I'll try and help out as much as I can.
Leah,winter_1,"Winter's here, and that means crystal fruit is in season. It has such a unique flavor, don't you think?"
Leah,winter_7,"I'm looking forward to carving ice sculptures tomorrow. I only get to do it once a year, but it's a lot of fun!"
Leah,winter_28,"Hey, here's to another great year at farm! Let's have some fun tonight! [348] # #Next year is going to be great, I can feel it."
Maru,Rainy_Day_0,I wonder how Penny is doing? Maybe I'll give her a call later today.
Maru,Rainy_Day_1,I was just daydreaming... do you think MARILDA is okay? I hope she finds some place where she truly belongs...
Maru,Rainy_Day_2,"Hey! I had trouble sleeping last night so I fiddled around in my workshop for a bit. Here, I made this for you. [688 369 338 325 287]# #I hope you can find some use for it."
Maru,Rainy_Day_3,The only thing I dislike about rain is the fact that I can't do any stargazing!
Maru,Rainy_Day_4,Do I hear a leak in the roof? I'll have to check it out. I know a thing or two about carpentry from watching my mother.
Maru,Rainy_Night_0,Make sure you don't leave your tools out in the rain! You wouldn't want them to get all rusty.
Maru,patio_Maru,"I'm not sure what this is, yet... but it's fun to turn the old wrench now and then."
Maru,Rainy_Night_1,Hi @. How was your day... soggy?# #This weather gives me gadget ideas... maybe if I funnel the rainwater it could power a mill?
Maru,Rainy_Night_2,"Dad's been tracking the weather patterns for the last twenty years.# #It's a little too early to tell, but the results have revealed some abnormal trends."
Maru,Rainy_Night_3,Can we have spaghetti in bed tonight?
Maru,Rainy_Night_4,"I made some dessert! Make sure to brush your teeth before bed, though. [232 234 223 220] "
Maru,Rainy_Night_5,"My day wasn't all that exciting... I stayed inside because of the weather.# #It was relaxing, though. I kicked back with the latest 'Schematics Weekly'."
Maru,Indoor_Day_0,"Hmm? Sorry, sometimes I get so lost in thought that I don't even realize what I'm doing."
Maru,Indoor_Day_1,I found this in my scrap pile. Think you could find a use for it? [286 287 205 732]
Maru,Indoor_Day_2,"Finally, you're up! I was getting so hungry... "
Maru,Indoor_Day_3,One of the best things about living on the farm is waking up to a chorus of songbirds.
Maru,Indoor_Day_4,How do you keep your hands so soft with all that farmwork?
Maru,Indoor_Night_0,Did you see the moon tonight? It always looks spectacular on the horizon.
Maru,Indoor_Night_1,I saw a shooting star earlier. I like to pretend it's MARILDA stopping by to check on us. 
Maru,Indoor_Night_2,I can't decide if I'm craving chocolate cake or ripe strawberries. Or maybe both...?# #Be honest... am I gaining weight? 
Maru,Indoor_Night_3,You did good work today! You deserve to relax the rest of the evening.
Maru,Indoor_Night_4,I'm really starting to love this old house. It's so cozy at night.# #Mom's done a great job improving the place. 
Maru,Outdoor_0,"Ahh... the farm smells great, it reminds me of the mountains near my parent's house."
Maru,Outdoor_1,"With a little planning, we could automate most of the farm work and just relax!"
Maru,Outdoor_2,It's going to be clear tonight... I wonder if the constellation will be visible?
Maru,Outdoor_3,"Don't worry, I won't mind if you track mud into the house. It's fun to get a little dirty now and then."
Maru,Outdoor_4,I never realized the amount of care and planning necessary to run a farm! It's a lot like working in the laboratory.
Maru,OneKid_0,Have you spent any time with today? Kids need playtime in order reach their full potential.
Maru,OneKid_1,What do you think... will grow up to be a farmer? Or an engineer?
Maru,OneKid_3,I have high hopes for our child. I've been reading all the scientific data on the best ways to raise children.
Maru,TwoKids_3,"My own workshop, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. Life is pretty good."
Maru,Good_1,"Now that we live together, it's hard to imagine being alone again."
Maru,Good_2,Taking a break? That's good!
Maru,Good_3,There's a lot of strategy to planning and running a farm. It's more intellectually stimulating than I thought!
Maru,Good_4,For a while there I was considering building a robotic husband. But you're a lot more fun! ^For a while there I was considering building a robotic wife. But you're a lot more fun! 
Maru,Good_5,I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. This is a very rare specimen! 
Maru,Good_6,"Last night, I had a dream that I was looking through a gigantic telescope. I saw something moving in the nebula. Kind of spooky."
Maru,Neutral_0,I hope you'd still like me even if I gained weight.
Maru,Neutral_8,I feel uninspired today. 
Maru,funLeave_Maru,I think I'll visit my parents today. I haven't seen them in a while.
Maru,funReturn_Maru,"Mom and Dad are doing just fine. Their routine is still the same, even with me gone. How was your day?"
Maru,spring_2,"So, what's your strategy for optimizing the farm this year?"
Maru,spring_1,It's wonderful to see all the plants and animals come back to life during the spring.
Maru,spring_22,If my brother wasn't such a hermit I'd invite him over for dinner sometime.
Maru,summer_20,I wonder if my brother will ever have the courage to ask Abigail out?
Maru,summer_2,I like to catalogue the different insects I see in summer.
Maru,fall_1,"With every season, a new section of the night sky becomes prominent. It's fascinating to witness."
Maru,fall_25,"Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house.# #Don't worry, dear. I'll take care of it all."
Maru,fall_3,Fall aways reminds me of going out woodcutting with my mom... it might be that smell of freshly cut wood and sap.
Maru,winter_15,The winters have been disturbingly mild lately.
Maru,winter_5,"I hope Dad's doing okay... he can get depressed in winter, when there's less opportunity for field research."
Maru,winter_2,"So, what are your plans for maintaining our income this winter?# #You could do some fishing or foraging...# #If you do any mining, promise me you'll be careful."
Maru,spring_Maru,"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @! "
Maru,summer_Maru,"The evenings are so warm, it's really the best time of year for stargazing. Who knows what might up there?"
Maru,fall_Maru,"The farm life is great, but I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community."
Maru,winter_Maru,"I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie in the spring. Oh... that tang, that zest!"
Maru,spouseRoom_Maru,"# .5#I got up early to do a little stargazing.# #I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey."
Penny,Rainy_Day_0,On rainy days my thoughts always drift toward cinnamon and cookies.
Penny,Rainy_Day_1,"I wonder if Maru and Dr. Harvey will ever get together? I'm sure Harvey likes her...# #I think Maru will have to make the first move, though. "
Penny,Rainy_Day_2,"Hi, honey! I did some shopping this morning and got this for you.[186 180 770 535]# #I thought you could really use one of the those. 1"
Penny,Rainy_Day_3,"Hmm... maybe I should experiment with a new recipe. You liked the last recipe I made, didn't you, honey?# #What was it called... 'Chili de @'?"
Penny,Rainy_Day_4,"On days like this, I love to curl up with a good book."
Penny,Rainy_Night_0,"How was your day, honey? I spent my afternoon reading a novel."
Penny,patio_Penny,This is a lot more peaceful than my old spot in town. I'm very happy here.
Penny,Rainy_Night_1,I'm sure Mom's at the saloon right now... But I don't feel so bad about it anymore. It's out of my hands.
Penny,Rainy_Night_2,I was just thinking about that night we met in the bathhouse. # #I'll never forget that night... 
Penny,Rainy_Night_3,"The sound of rain used to bother me, when I lived in that old metal trailer. But it's quite soothing here."
Penny,Rainy_Night_4,I felt like making a nice dinner. I hope you like it. [212 214 225 209 200] 
Penny,Indoor_Day_0,"It's so peaceful here. I used to have the most horrific nightmares, but now I sleep like a baby."
Penny,Indoor_Day_1,"Good morning, @! I made you a hot breakfast.[195 210 211]# #It's important to me that you leave here with a full belly. "
Penny,Indoor_Day_2,"You know, I think I'll read a book today. I picked up something new from the library last time I was there.# #Gunther asked me to say hi."
Penny,Indoor_Day_3,"I love to hear about all the artifacts you've found. Archaeology is fascinating!# #To think... there may have been farmers at this very spot 10,000 years ago."
Penny,Indoor_Day_4,"Was I shy when we first met? It's funny to think about, now that we've come so far. "
Penny,Indoor_Night_0,"Good evening, honey. Did you accomplish everything you wanted to today?# #If not, that's okay. We've got all the time in the world!"
Penny,Indoor_Night_1,"Hmm... skirt or pants tomorrow? Oh, who am I kidding... I always go with the skirt."
Penny,Indoor_Night_2,We have it good here. We should always try and remember those less fortunate than us.# #I'm just very grateful for what we have.
Penny,Indoor_Night_3,Mom's probably pretty lonely now that I'm gone. I just hope she doesn't visit the saloon more to make up for it.# #You shouldn't feel bad! Mom has to solve her own problems. 
Penny,Indoor_Night_4,Ready to tuck in? I made the bed and everything... 1
Penny,Outdoor_0,"I only ever dreamed of living in such a beautiful place, and now it's come true.# #I was so miserable back home. "
Penny,Outdoor_1,Isn't this a perfect place to raise children?# #I would've been so happy growing up on a farm.
Penny,Outdoor_2,"Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!# #I'll be thinking of you. "
Penny,Outdoor_3,I just saw a songbird flying due west. In Stardew Valley that's a very good omen. 
Penny,Outdoor_4,"Ahh... It feels great to be outside. I could spend all day right here, observing every little thing."
Penny,OneKid_0,Have you had any time to play with today? Maybe a second child will make things better.
Penny,OneKid_1,Little is going to have such a great childhood here.
Penny,OneKid_3,I feel a lot older now that we have a child. Maybe it's just this new responsibility weighing on me.# #It's not bad! I've wanted this for a long time. 1
Penny,TwoKids_0,I already gave and their food. They're such hungry children!
Penny,TwoKids_1,We have to make sure and give a lot of attention now that we have . We don't want any jealousy between them.
Penny,TwoKids_2,I've had this dream that grew wings and flew into the night sky. What does it mean?
Penny,TwoKids_3,"A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. We're so very fortunate."
Penny,Good_0,@...I still can't believe we're married... 
Penny,Good_1,I had dreams of marrying you for such a long time. 
Penny,Good_2,I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here... 
Penny,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave? ^Wow, you look beautiful today. Did you do something different with your hair? "
Penny,Good_4,This place is really starting to feel like home. 
Penny,Good_6,Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry that you aren't eating enough wholesome food.
Penny,funLeave_Penny,"I'm going to head into town today, just for fun. I'll be back in a while!"
Penny,funReturn_Penny,I had a nice time... It's good to stay in contact with everyone. Tell me about your day.
Penny,spring_8,Spring is probably my favorite season. There's a certain freshness in the air that fills me with hope.
Penny,spring_1,"We've got a long, warm year to look forward to. Let's make it a productive one."
Penny,spring_15,"Ah, the 'spring cleaning'... I'm actually going to enjoy this."
Penny,summer_16, ... I need to eat more melon to combat this heat!
Penny,summer_1,"Summer may be searing hot, but the humidity feels great on the skin."
Penny,summer_2,"In summer, the ants become very active. I could watch them for hours... they have a pretty complex civilization from the looks of it!"
Penny,fall_5,"The smell of fall reminds me of the smell of books... weird, isn't it?"
Penny,fall_1,Fall... It makes me think of colored paper and glue. Maybe I'm spending too much time with the children. 
Penny,fall_2,Will you grow any giant pumpkins this year? 1
Penny,winter_1,Winter's a good time to unwind a bit. You deserve it after the long year!
Penny,winter_6,"The falling snow reminds me of grandma, rocking by the fire. I have this vivid memory of her shadow, flickering against the orange wood... That was long ago."
Penny,winter_3,"How will we stay afloat this winter? Oh, you don't have to tell me... I trust you to make the right decisions."
Sam,Rainy_Day_0,"Might be a good day to sit back and jam on the guitar...# #Hey, you can relax too if you want."
Sam,Rainy_Day_1,Do you think Sebastian and Abigail will ever hook up?# #Heh... now that I'm married I'm trying to get everyone else married too.
Sam,Rainy_Day_2,"Hey, I found one of these rolling around in the back of a drawer. [90 88 86 535]# #I thought you might be able to use it."
Sam,Rainy_Day_3,"Aw, man. These cloudy days are kind of a drag... "
Sam,Rainy_Day_4,How'd you sleep? The sound of rain really makes me zonk.
Sam,patio_Sam, ... I'm never gonna land this trick... 
Sam,Rainy_Night_0,"Hey, how was your day? I just layed around and read comics most of the day... it was great. "
Sam,Rainy_Night_1,"It was a pretty low-key day for me... colas, frozen pizza, a few hours noodling around on the guitar. I feel relaxed."
Sam,Rainy_Night_2,"Earlier, I listened to our live recording from that show we played. Remember that? Man, was that sloppy.# #It made me a little nervous that you were there, I didn't want to mess up and have you think I was a loser! 0"
Sam,Rainy_Night_3,"I hope Vincent's not too lonely now that I'm gone... I kinda felt responsible for the little guy. # #But, life's all about change... right? Kids need to learn that, eventually... Or else adulthood will destroy them. "
Sam,Rainy_Night_4,"Hey, I tossed a couple frozen pizzas into the oven. Here's yours. [206] "
Sam,Indoor_Day_0,Phew... I'll tell you one thing I don't miss about my old life... working at JojaMart.
Sam,Indoor_Day_1,"Hey, I made you some instant pancakes. Enjoy. [211] # #What? I never learned to cook... mom always did that."
Sam,Indoor_Day_2,"Hey. I know I joke around a lot, but I want you to know that I seriously love you... "
Sam,Indoor_Day_3,"Do you have big plans for the day?# #Oh, not me... I usually decide what to do a few moments beforehand..."
Sam,Indoor_Day_4,Um... Maybe I'll help out on the farm some other day. I feel lazy today. # #You're not mad?
Sam,Indoor_Night_0,"Hey, you look tired. Let me help you relax tonight, okay? Maybe I'll give you a massage later."
Sam,Indoor_Night_1,My day? Oh... I can hardly remember. I didn't really do anything of note. Just relaxed and had a good time.
Sam,Indoor_Night_2,"Hey, sorry I didn't make the bed. You know I'm sloppy... that's why you like me, right? "
Sam,Indoor_Night_3,The only thing I miss about living at home is Mom's fish casserole
Sam,Indoor_Night_4,Ready to hit the hay? I actually made the bed for once...
Sam,Outdoor_0,Maybe I should get some off-road wheels for my skateboard. Mayor Lewis can't touch me out here. 
Sam,Outdoor_1,I always keep an eye on the wide blue sky... you never know when a UFO might go by.
Sam,Outdoor_2,"Hi, @! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!# #I'll try and help you with encouraging thoughts. "
Sam,Outdoor_3,Something in the air makes me feel positive... maybe it's the faint whiff of pizza from Gus' ovens.
Sam,Outdoor_4,"Wow... you look great today, and the specks of mud just add some extra charm. "
Sam,OneKid_0,I'll change 's diaper... don't worry about it. You've got enough on your plate.
Sam,OneKid_1,"It's weird, but I really like being a father! "
Sam,OneKid_3,I think we should have another kid. Why stop now?
Sam,TwoKids_0,"I woke up early, fed the kids and changed their diapers! We're all set. You can just focus on raking in that sweet money. # #I'm just kidding... I didn't marry you for the money."
Sam,TwoKids_1,We have to make sure and give a lot of attention now that we have . We don't want any jealousy between them.
Sam,TwoKids_2,It's fun to see the babies playing with each other. I think they're going to be very close.
Sam,TwoKids_3,"I never thought I'd become such a family man, but I'm really satisfied with what we've built here. Life is going great. "
Sam,Good_1,"Do you ever think of that night we snuck into my room? I do, often... "
Sam,Good_2,"You know, I think I had a feeling we'd be together from the very beginning. There's just something special between us. "
Sam,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you do something with your hair? ^Wow, you look stunning today. Did you do something new with your hair? "
Sam,Good_6,Be careful out there! I know you go into the caves sometimes... you could be eaten alive in there!
Sam,Good_4,"Baby, I was just gonna write you a song on the guitar. But now you're here and I feel relaxed.# #I mainly feel like playing guitar when I'm lonely."
Sam,Good_5,"Baby, talk to me! I'm always interested to hear about your day."
Sam,funLeave_Sam,"I'm gonna visit the family today, okay? I'll be home in the evening."
Sam,funReturn_Sam,"Seeing family is nice, but it's also kind of depressing in a weird way. Like... our lives are totally separate now, and everything feels more formal than it used to. "
Sam,spring_1,Ub... spring... my doze... allergies. 
Sam,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be cool to see Sebastian again.
Sam,spring_23,"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I thought I could get out of it now that we're married.# #Whatever. I guess it's funny in a weird way."
Sam,summer_1,"The pollen count is a little lower in summer, so my nose is really happy. "
Sam,summer_10,"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?# #It might be funny to put something nasty. You know, to play a prank on the governor! # #Sorry..."
Sam,summer_27,"Summer's great, but I'm ready for the fall now.# #Should we watch the jellyfish tomorrow night? It's always kind of fun."
Sam,fall_1,It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.
Sam,fall_15,"Hey, tomorrow's the fair. I need to get my old slingshot wrist back in shape..."
Sam,fall_26,I wonder if Mom will let Vincent enter the haunted maze this year. Probably not... # #Poor kid. He's gonna have to grow up some day...
Sam,winter_1,The cold air makes my hair gel freeze. It's not very pleasant. 
Sam,winter_7,Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? It might be fun to see everyone again...
Sam,winter_28,"We had a great year, @... it's kind of sad that it's over.# #We'll just have to make next year even better! "
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_0,Finally... some heavy rain. I get bored of sunny weather easily.
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_1,"Hey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell...# #I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long."
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_2,"Hey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this... want it?[575 769 767 84 66 78]# #I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you. "
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_3,"Seems like a pretty good day to just lay around, maybe read a book or something... what do you think?"
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_4,"Hey, another rainy day... perfect.# #You look cold... here, come closer. "
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_0,I'm trying my best to quit smoking now that we're married... I don't wanna die on you. It's a bad habit.# #I want to have a future together. 
Sebastian,patio_Sebastian,Need something? I'll just be over here working on my bike for a while.
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_1,"I did some work on the laptop today. I was actually brainstorming some ideas for a game I want to make.# #With your farming income, I can afford to do what I want with my life. It's pretty amazing. Thank you. "
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_2,"Sorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something.# #I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores..."
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_3,"How was your day? Did you slay any monsters? # #It feels good to take out your aggression now and then, doesn't it?"
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_4,Maybe a witch will visit us tonight? Hah.. if only life was that interesting...
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_0,"The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy.# #The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner."
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_1,Hey... want some coffee?[395] # #I needed some... woke up early from a nightmare and I just couldn't fall back asleep.
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_2,"I couldn't sleep last night so I went for a night ride on the motorcycle.# #I need to stay independent, even though we're married. That's just how I am. I still love you, though. "
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_3,"Hey. How'd you sleep last night? I heard you mumbling.# #You seemed scared, but I have to admit... it was kind of cute. "
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_4,Living here with you is teaching me to come out of my shell a little bit. I think it's good for me. 
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_0,"Hey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting...# #...# #The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch."
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_1,"Maybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired.# #I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes. "
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_2,It's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time.# #I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone.
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_3,"I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there."
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_4,"I often felt unappreciated back home... but here I feel like I really belong. Thanks for making me feel welcome, @. "
Sebastian,Outdoor_0,"I feel like I want to do something today... but I'm not sure what. Do you ever have that problem, @?"
Sebastian,Outdoor_1,"Hmm... sometimes I have to force myself to stay outside for health.# #I dunno what it is, but I like being indoors. Maybe I'm just so used to my dark basement."
Sebastian,Outdoor_2,I'll just watch you from here. # #I enjoy watching you.
Sebastian,Outdoor_3,I don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out?# #Just an idea... 
Sebastian,Outdoor_4,"We should raise more slimes... In big quantities they can be pretty profitable. And they're so easy to raise.# #Also, different colored slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us."
Sebastian,OneKid_0,"I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of ! It's just... something new."
Sebastian,OneKid_1,"Maybe when is a little older, I'll get a sidecar for the bike and we can all go for a ride. "
Sebastian,OneKid_3,Have you smelled ? Maybe it's time for a bath...
Sebastian,TwoKids_0,"Don't worry, I already fed the kids... spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again."
Sebastian,TwoKids_1,"I hope and are nice to each other. Maru and I always fought as kids.# #If I think back on it, it was mostly my fault..."
Sebastian,TwoKids_2,"I've had this recurring dream that is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?"
Sebastian,TwoKids_3,"We've come a long way, @. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation.# #Now that I'm here, I like it... "
Sebastian,Good_0,Hey. Look at me. Never forget that I love you... you're everything to me. # #Now go make us some money. 
Sebastian,Good_1,Hey... come here. You look great today. 
Sebastian,Good_2,"You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day. "
Sebastian,Good_3,"I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made. "
Sebastian,Good_4,You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.
Sebastian,Good_5,Sometimes I feel so angry... but when you show up I always start to calm down. # #Maybe I'll mellow out with age.
Sebastian,Good_6,"I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?"
Sebastian,Good_8,I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.
Sebastian,Good_9,I don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird?# #I guess I'm not like most people.
Sebastian,Neutral_0,When I take walks I do my best to avoid everyone. I hate being pressured into small talk.
Sebastian,Neutral_2,Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...
Sebastian,Neutral_3,"Are you going into town today? Why, what are you up to?"
Sebastian,Neutral_4,I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm.
Sebastian,Neutral_5,Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop...
Sebastian,Neutral_6,"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways."
Sebastian,Neutral_8,"House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast."
Sebastian,Bad_5,"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?"
Sebastian,Bad_6,What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away. 
Sebastian,Bad_7,This place is starting to feel like a tomb. 
Sebastian,Bad_8,I started smoking again... I've just been really stressed out lately. 
Sebastian,funLeave_Sebastian,I'm going to take a walk today. I need some time to myself. I'll see you in the evening.
Sebastian,funReturn_Sebastian,"My day was fine, nothing much to tell you about. Why don't you tell me about yours?"
Sebastian,spring_1,Oohh... my head. Happy new year... 
Sebastian,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be good to see Sam again.
Sebastian,spring_23,"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? Do we have to go?# #I hate wearing that ridiculous tight jumpsuit. Why does Lewis make us do this? "
Sebastian,summer_1,Summer's here... I need to start slathering the sunscreen pretty thick if I want to maintain my pale complexion...
Sebastian,summer_10,Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?# #I have no idea what's good... you're the chef! 
Sebastian,summer_27,The weather's starting to cool off. It feels great.# #Should we go to the festival tomorrow night? It's actually a tradition I kind of enjoy. 
Sebastian,fall_1,It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.
Sebastian,fall_15,"The Stardew Valley Fair is a little crowded for my tastes... but I'll just hang out with Sam. It'll be good to catch up with him.# #You should play some carnival games, though! Don't worry about me. "
Sebastian,fall_26,I'm excited for the Spirit's Eve tomorrow. I wonder what horrors we'll find there. 
Sebastian,winter_1,What are your plans this winter? I know it's more of a laid-back time for you.
Sebastian,winter_7,Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?
Sebastian,winter_28,"It's been a great year, @. We should celebrate a little. [346] # #I'm sure next year will be even better. "
Shane,Rainy_Day_0,I hope Jas and Marnie are doing alright without me.# #I'm not too worried... Jas is old enough now to take care of the animals on her own.
Shane,Rainy_Day_1,You know what? I think I've lost some weight since moving in with you. 
Shane,Rainy_Day_2,Here... take this.[346 174 303 305 215]# #I bought some of those a while ago and they're almost expired...
Shane,Rainy_Day_3,Buhh... I don't feel like being productive today.
Shane,Rainy_Day_4,"@, should I do something useful today?... or just nap forever?"
Shane,Rainy_Night_0,"Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls.# #Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture. "
Shane,patio_Shane,Charlie's doing well. 
Shane,Rainy_Night_1,The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.
Shane,Rainy_Night_2,"I guess... if I had some pants I might've gone outside today... but, nah."
Shane,Rainy_Night_3,"I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens."
Shane,Rainy_Night_4,Tip-tappa-tip-tappa-tip... I'm starting to feel thirsty. 
Shane,Indoor_Day_0,"Buh... sometimes life feels like a slow, gray blur... know what I mean?"
Shane,Indoor_Day_1,Hey. Take this... I put a bit too much in the microwave. [195 215 206]# #Sorry if it's squishy.
Shane,Indoor_Day_2,"Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens."
Shane,Indoor_Day_3," ... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls. "
Shane,Indoor_Day_4,"I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy. "
Shane,Indoor_Night_0,I'm just gonna have a couple more beers before closing my eyes for the night.
Shane,Indoor_Night_1,"If... If only... ah, I was just thinking back on the glory days, when I played gridball on the varsity team. # #Now I'm old and weak, though..."
Shane,Indoor_Night_2,Ughh... ... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce.
Shane,Indoor_Night_3,Buh... I wish I was six inches taller and a whole lot smarter...# #You like me for who I am? I still have a hard time understanding that...
Shane,Indoor_Night_4,I spent all day watching TV and now my legs feel like soft dough. Guess I'll have to take it easy until tomorrow.
Shane,Outdoor_0,"I didn't sleep well last night so I'm hoping this fresh air will get the juices flowing.# #What juices, you ask? Heh... you're weird. "
Shane,Outdoor_1,"Sometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh.# #But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway? "
Shane,Outdoor_2,When I stop and think about it... I'm in a good place. My life is pretty nice. 
Shane,Outdoor_3,Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers. 
Shane,Outdoor_4,"Hey, @. You were sleeping like a baby so I slipped out of bed and went for a morning walk around the farm. Everything looks fine."
Shane,OneKid_0,"It's weird, when I was younger I swore I'd never have a kid. I wonder what happened to me? "
Shane,OneKid_1,Let's make sure to give lots of eggs... Baby's gotta grow those legs!
Shane,OneKid_3,Papa Shane reporting for duty... # #Buh... I've become corny in my old age.
Shane,TwoKids_0,I already fed the kids two bowls of pizza puffs cereal. They'll be full for a while.
Shane,TwoKids_1,I'll be honest... two kids is enough for me.
Shane,TwoKids_2,Ugh... is being a little brat today. Must've gotten that from me...
Shane,TwoKids_3, ... If only we could send the kids off to Joja work-camp for a season...# #I'm just kidding. 
Shane,Good_0, ... ... mmm... what's that wonderful fragrance you're wearing? Eau de pepperoni? 
Shane,Good_1,"You're a lot better-looking than me, you know that? "
Shane,Good_2,The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke.
Shane,Good_3,I'm in a great mood today... The Tunnelers won big last night. 
Shane,Good_4,"Hey, if I ever seem cranky, just ignore it. I get in weird moods sometimes, but it's not about you... okay?"
Shane,Good_5,"Ah... life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting. # #You think it was depressing out front? Kid, you should've seen the back room..."
Shane,Good_6,"Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need. "
Shane,Good_8,I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.
Shane,Good_9,"Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You really have a short memory span, don't you? "
Shane,Neutral_0,"Oh, do you need something from me? Sorry, I'm kind of busy at the moment."
Shane,Neutral_2,Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...
Shane,Neutral_3,"Working at Joja was a drag, but at least I got to interact with people occasionally."
Shane,Neutral_4,"What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually..."
Shane,Neutral_5,Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to work at Joja.
Shane,Neutral_6,"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys."
Shane,Neutral_8,"Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright."
Shane,Bad_5,"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?"
Shane,Bad_6,What do you want? You sound like Marnie on one of her bad days. Go away. 
Shane,Bad_7,Farm-life is actually really boring. What am I doing here? 
Shane,Bad_8,"Yeah... ... Sure, honey. Whatever you say... "
Shane,funLeave_Shane,"I'm going to go out today, alright?"
Shane,funReturn_Shane,"Sorry if I'm sweaty... That was quite a walk... Buh, I'm out of shape. "
Shane,spring_1,Ooo... my throbbing head. How many did I have last night?
Shane,spring_12,"The egg festival is probably my favorite... you know how I am, I go crazy for anything to do with chickens. "
Shane,spring_23,"Oh, right. It's the flower dance tomorrow. Hey, if it makes you happy, I'm happy."
Shane,summer_1,I like seeing all the tropical plants this time of year. The valley gets so lush.
Shane,summer_10,I might fast until the luau tomorrow. I need the ol' bag to be empty so I can fill it with piping hot soup. 
Shane,summer_27,What are your plans for the fall? I'm going to try and incorporate more wine into my diet.
Shane,fall_1,Hmm... I might have to buy a few cases of pumpkin ale to celebrate the season... 
Shane,fall_15,"I'll be helping Marnie with the animals at tomorrow's fair, like usual. You should just kick back and have some fun. "
Shane,fall_17,I'm starting to really feel my age... and I'm not comfortable with that at all.
Shane,winter_1,Any big plans this winter? I'll probably end up watching a lot of TV and just hanging out around the house.
Shane,winter_28,"Well, another year gone by... I look a little older, but that's about all. "
Maru,Introduction,"Oh! Aren't you the one who just moved in?# #I'm Maru. I've been looking forward to meeting you! # #You know, with a small town like this, a new face can really alter the community dynamic. It's exciting!"
Maru,Resort_Entering,Willy mentioned that you helped fix the boat. Thanks for doing that!
Maru,Resort_Leaving,That was fun!
Maru,Resort,"I've been noticing a few different starfish species. My favorite are the big purple ones, but they're all very interesting!"
Maru,Resort_Towel, ... It's a solar eclipse! # #Oh... nevermind. It's just your body blocking the sun.
Maru,Resort_Towel_2,"We're so far removed from civilization out here.# #Imagine the stars you could see at night.# #Who knows, maybe we'd even see a flying saucer or two! "
Maru,Resort_Bar,Mmmm... Why are tropical fruits so good?
Maru,Resort_Shore,"I wonder if Willy would let me bring my telescope here sometime...#The sky is so clear here, I bet I could spot Pelican Town out in the horizon.#Maybe I'd even see you running around Farm!"
Maru,danceRejection,I'm flattered! But... No.
Maru,divorced,We have nothing to say to each other. 
Maru,breakUp,"Not good enough for you, huh? # #Fine... "
Maru,dumped_Girls,"You've got some nerve, speaking to me! "
Maru,secondChance_Girls,"You've lost some respect with me, @... but I'm willing to forgive you. "
Maru,Mon,"Whenever I'm struggling with a technical problem, I always take a walk.# #It's surprising how much a change of scenery can help."
Maru,Tue,Have you met my mother? She's the town's carpenter.
Maru,Wed,"On Tuesdays and Thursdays I work at Harvey's clinic.# #He says he likes having me around in case his medical equipment goes haywire! # #Being a farmer must be pretty easy, huh?"
Maru,Thu,I plan on spending a lot of time with my telescope this summer.
Maru,Sat,"Do you know my Dad, Demetrius? He's a scientist. I have a lot of fun helping him out in the laboratory."
Maru,Fri,"Hey, sorry if I seem cranky... I'm a little sore from work yesterday.# .5# I had to carry ten boxes of medical files to the attic!# #I had to sort patient records for four hours straight! "

Maru,Sun_01_01,"Well that's good, isn't it? "
Maru,Sun_01_02,Yikes! I'm sorry. Have you ever thought of doing something different...? 
Maru,Tue2,Stop by our house when you need to upgrade your buildings.# #It's always nice to have visitors.
Maru,Fri4,My mother is a carpenter and my dad is a scientist. I guess it makes sense that I'm into building gadgets.
Maru,Mon6,Sometimes my head gets so cluttered with nonsense I can hardly think. Does that ever happen to you?# #Getting some fresh air usually helps.
Maru,Wed8,"I work at Harvey's clinic on Tuesdays and Thursdays.# #He's nice, but not really my type..."
Maru,Thu10,"Oh, @! Is there anything you want to talk to me about? "
Maru,Event_Hospital_1,Of course he'll know the difference! This sample is completely ruined! 
Maru,Event_Hospital_2,"Okay. I'll blame it on you, then. "
Maru,Event_Hospital_3,You're right. I should just tell him the truth. 
Maru,Event_Space1,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
Maru,Event_Space2,"I guess you could see it like that... # #But it's still incredible, isn't it?"
Maru,Event_Cut1,"Oh no? # #Well, that makes me feel a little better, then. Thanks."
Maru,Event_Cut2,Oh no! Aghh... I'm really really sorry. 
Maru,event_robot1,"Thanks. That means a lot to me, @.# #I know gadgets aren't really your kind of thing... but I do appreciate that you're showing interest in what I do.# #I wish I could return the favor somehow. "
Maru,event_robot2,What? After she said point-blank that she doesn't want to be a slave? How cold... 
Maru,event_robot3,"Heh... # #Yeah I guess he did kinda say that, didn't he? # #...Um... "
Maru,event_robot4,... # #@... 
Maru,event_robot_explain1,"... # #You have a point, I did program her to act human... but her neural net is so complex, I can't be sure conciousness didn't emerge on its own. # #Furthermore, isn't it a little arrogant to assume that human-like consciousness is the only worthwhile vessel of existence? Computer brains are different than ours, but that doesn't mean we can disregard them. "
Maru,event_robot_explain2,I see. Well it wasn't a very funny joke. 
Maru,event_robot_explain3,"That's horrible! What's gotten into you, @? # #I'm just going to forget about this conversation... you aren't acting yourself. "
Maru,summer_1,This is going to be a great season for stargazing.
Maru,summer_Mon,Hmm... What sort of gadget should I tinker with this summer?
Maru,summer_Mon6,Come to my room if you ever want to tinker with my gadgets.
Maru,summer_Tue,"Sebastian is my half-brother, if you didn't know already.# #We look totally different."
Maru,summer_Tue4,"Sebastian hardly ever talks to me. I wonder if he even likes me at all?# #It's sad, I want to have a brother but he doesn't act like one."

Maru,Thu_01_old,See you later.
Maru,Thu_0,Really? Are you sure you're not just trying to flatter me?
Maru,Thu_01_01,You don't think I could do it? 
Maru,Thu_01_02,"You're right, but I love a challenge! "
Maru,summer_Sat,"Hey, have any interesting farm stories to tell me?# #Guess not."
Maru,summer_Fri,I worked at the clinic yesterday. We didn't have a single patient.# #I guess people get sick less during summer.
Maru,summer_Sun,I bet you're growing some interesting crops right now.# #Dad says a lot of exotic plants grow in the valley this time of year.
Maru,summer_Fri2,"Hey, tell me a story about farming.# #That's really interesting!"
Maru,summer_Wed4,Is it just me or did it suddenly get really hot?# #I guess it's just me.
Maru,summer_Sun6,Some day I'm going to be a world-class inventor. # #You're lucky to be friends with me!# #...just kidding.
Maru,summer_Tue8,"@, you're looking sharp today. "
Maru,summer_Thu10,How do your hands stay so soft with all that farm work?
Maru,fall_Mon,Have you explored the mines much? I've heard you can find some useful materials there.
Maru,fall_Tue,The trees look beautiful today! 
Maru,fall_Thu,In other parts of the world it's spring right now. Imagine that!
Maru,fall_Wed,Bleh... I don't feel like working tomorrow.
Maru,fall_Fri,I bet we'll start seeing more people at the clinic this season. # #I hope everyone stays healthy.

Maru,fall_Sun,"Hey, here's to another good week! "
Maru,fall_Tue2,"@, I just love how the trees look right now!# #I know you like them too."
Maru,fall_Wed4,"If you have any extra metal laying around, I could always use it for one of my projects.# #But only if you don't need it yourself."
Maru,fall_Fri6,I've been feeling especially optimistic lately... 
Maru,fall_Mon8,You should come visit me at the clinic Tomorrow. I work from 10 a.m.to 4 p.m. 
Maru,fall_Thu10,You have a leaf in your hair. Let me get it for you.# #... 
Maru,winter_1,"Oh man, it's so cold... "
Maru,winter_Mon,Did you see the snowman I built? 
Maru,winter_Tue,My hair gets so frizzy in this dry weather. 
Maru,winter_Wed,I guess winter is a good time to work on my gadgets.# #I wonder if I could make anything useful for farmers?
Maru,winter_Thu,Hey! What's up?# #It's a good time to explore the caves.# #I would go but my Dad would flip.
Maru,winter_Fri,I hope I don't catch the flu this year.
Maru,winter_Sat,Have you built a furnace yet?# #You can use them to turn raw material like ores into more useful products. 
Maru,winter_Sun,I get so sleepy when it's cold...
Maru,winter_Sat2,"Hey, if any of your farming machines need to be fixed, just let me know. "
Maru,winter_Tue4,"Hey, do you have any ideas for a new gadget I can make?# #Mhmm. I trust your opinion."

Penny,winter_Mon,On the 25th we'll be having the Feast of the Winter Star. It's one of my favorite events.# #It's supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in your life... but for most people it's just a time to relax and exchange gifts.
Sam,10,"Did you watch the game last night?# #Or wait, do you even have a TV set...?"
Sam,14,"Ugh, I stepped in something gross earlier... and I just bought these shoes. "
Sam,Introduction,"Hey, I'm Sam. Good to meet you. "
Sam,Resort_Entering,"Wow, what a spot!"
Sam,Resort,"I bet there's some cool stuff deeper on the island.# #Willy said we have to stay here, though... some kind of liability issues or something. "
Sam,Resort_Leaving,I'm feeling pretty good from all the sunlight. 
Sam,Resort_Shore,Check out these gnarly waves... Guess what? I'm gonna save up for a surfboard.
Sam,Resort_Towel, is playing a jazzy tune on his guitar.
Sam,Resort_Towel_2,"Maybe I should learn to play the ukelele.# #Abby on the congas and Sebastian on the steel drums... 'The Pelicans of Paradise'... # #What's the matter, you look worried. "
Sam,Resort_Bar,"I'm just getting juiced up, then it's back to the beach."
Sam,danceRejection,Hmm... I dunno. Maybe next year. 
Sam,dumped_Guys,... 
Sam,secondChance_Guys,"Alright, I'm done with the cold shoulder act. Let's just forget about what happened. "
Sam,breakUp,"Wait... what?! # #I thought we were doing okay... I guess I was way off... alright, then. # #Yeah, sure... we can still be friends. "
Sam,divorced,"I'm sorry, @. I don't think I can still be your friend. "
Sam,Mon2,"Hey, how's it going?# #Last night I practiced guitar for 4 hours straight. My fingers hurt like crazy. # #Bye, I've got something to do..."
Sam,Mon,"Hey, farmer."
Sam,Mon8,I'll tell you a secret... my name 'Sam' is short for 'Samson'. 0# #Most people don't know that so keep it on mute.
Sam,Tue,"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.# #Take it easy."
Sam,Tue4,"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?# #Sleeping feels nice but sometimes I wish I could skip it... it's just such a time-waster."
Sam,Wed,"I'm trying to come up with a new song for my band, but I'm blanking...# Wed_old#Hey.. What do you think my new song should be about?# 20 30 Wed_20#Farming, mining, and chopping wood.# 8820 30 Wed_20#A city in the sea.# 8821 30 Wed_20#Trains.# 19 -50 Wed_19#Choose anything. It'll still be a horrible song."
Sam,Wed_old, 19#But I already know what you think about it. |Thanks to your help I'm already done with the lyrics! 
Sam,Wed_19,"Hey, man... what the heck is your problem? Sorry I asked. "
Sam,Wed_20,"Hey, you know what? That sounds perfect. Thanks! "
Sam,Wed6,I've been friends with Sebastian for a while. He's a pretty cool guy.# #If you two weren't around I wouldn't really have any friends in town.
Sam,Wed10,Hey buddy. You look like you're full of energy today!^@. Um... I just wanted to say... You look nice today. 0
Sam,Thu6_1,"I think my Dad might be coming back in a year or so.# #I guess you might be able to meet him, then. If you're still living here.# #You wouldn't abandon the farm after putting so much effort into it!"
Sam,Thu6_2,...I have mixed feelings about my father being back. He seems strange. # #But I guess I haven't seen him in 3 years... so that could explain it.
Sam,Thu_3, ... what am I still doing here?
Sam,Thu,"The clouds look great this time of year, don't they?# #Like scoops of vanilla ice cream floating on blue raspberry sauce... Or maybe I'm just hungry."
Sam,Thu2,"My Dad is a soldier, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here...# #He'll come back someday.# #...I've heard some terrible things about the Gotoro Empire... "
Sam,Thu_2,"Well, my Dad is back. Have you met him?# #I'm just glad he's okay."
Sam,Thu2_2,"Well, my Dad is back. Have you met him?# #I'm just glad he's okay."
Sam,Fri,"Did I ever tell you we used to live in the city?# #There's a lot more stuff going on, but it's also kinda noisy and hectic... It's hard to say which is better."
Sam,Fri4,Dad used to work as a garbage man in the city.# #You don't even want to know some of the things he found in people's trash.
Sam,Fri10,"The older I get the more attached I feel to the valley.# #Although I could be biased... for a certain reason. 0# #So, how are you doing today? "
Sam,Sat4,"Oh! I just remembered I'm supposed to call my Grandma. Okay, I'm going to put this rubber band on my wrist so I don't forget.# #I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things. "
Sam,Sat,Hmm. I just remembered that I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.# #This happens to me all the time.
Sam,Sun8,Sometimes I wonder if my mother is actually happy with her life... # #I asked her once and got the feeling she was hiding some inner pain.
Sam,Sun,"Oh, it's a nice day... isn't it?"
Sam,spring_21,"Sometimes those spring petals that float around make my nose drip. # #I like summer best, myself."
Sam,Event_band1,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."
Sam,Event_band2,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."
Sam,Event_band3,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."
Sam,Event_band4,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."
Sam,event_room1,"Oh, I see."
Sam,spring_12,My little brother gets so excited for festivals. He's been talking about tomorrow's egg hunt all day.
Sam,spring_23,Why couldn't the flower dance be today so I could get work off? 
Sam,winter_7,"One time, Gus fell in the river during the Ice Festival. We had to build a huge fire in the saloon to dry him out.# #We were all worried we'd never taste his famous spaghetti ever again."
Sam,fall_26,"Tonight, after everyone is asleep, that weird old man who lives in the woods will set up the haunted maze. He always makes sure no one is around to see him working."
Sam,summer_10,I don't have to work tomorrow! I've never been so happy. 
Sam,winter_24,The Feast of the Winter Star is supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in life.# #Me? I'm mostly interested in the food. Hehe. 
Sam,event_room2,Yeah... That's what happened!
Sam,event_snack1,He's right... That's what happened. ^She's right... that's what happened. 
Sam,event_snack2,Yeah... That's what happened!
Sam,event_snack3,What!? He's lying! ^What!? She's lying! 
Sam,summer_Mon2,"Hey, how's it going?# #I'm hungry.# #See you later."
Sam,summer_Mon6,Have you been to the desert yet?# #You can find some interesting things there. Dad took me a couple times when I was younger.
Sam,summer_Mon,There's a little less pollen in the summer... my nose is really happy.
Sam,summer_Tue,"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.# #Goodbye for now."
Sam,summer_Tue4,"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?# #I'm so energized during summer I hardly have to sleep!"
Sam,summer_Wed,Hi. Taking the day off?# #Sounds interesting.
Sam,summer_Wed2,I saw a spider on my ceiling last night. They sure like the warmth.# #I hope he didn't crawl into my mouth while I was asleep... 
Sam,summer_Thu,"Dad was telling me about our national enemy, the Gotoro Empire... They sound like a ruthless bunch."
Sam,summer_Thu6_1,Sometimes I can hear my Dad pacing down the hallway at night. # #...But he won't tell us what's troubling him.
Sam,summer_Fri,"You know... I used to live in the city and I have to admit, this place is much nicer in the summer. # #The city is so hot with all that concrete."
Sam,summer_Sun,"When you see hot air balloons drifting over the sea, you'll know that summer's in full swing."
Sam,fall_Mon2,I like taking walks in the forest this time of year. The temperature is so comfortable# #... 
Sam,fall_Mon,"Oh, hi. Are you making friends with anyone in town?# #Bye."
Sam,fall_Tue,"My shoes always seem to wear out this time of year. Look, my toe's poking through! # #That's what happens when you skateboard too much."
Sam,fall_9,I ordered a new pair of shoes online. They're the same style so I know they'll fit right.
Sam,fall_16,"I ordered some shoes online more than a week ago! Man, they're really taking a long time.# #I guess we must really live in the middle of nowhere. "
Sam,fall_23,"Ah, my feet feel great in these new shoes. They're a little crisp, but they'll break in. Especially after I run through the haunted maze this weekend. "
Sam,fall_Tue4,"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?# #Just stop by whenever you want."
Sam,fall_Wed,"Hey... something smells good, like pizza.# #Do you smell that? Maybe Mom's cooking something."
Sam,fall_Thu6_1,I think my Dad might be coming back next year.# #I guess that's kind of soon. Weird.
Sam,fall_Thu6,"I guess I should start thinking about moving out soon... # #...But I would miss Mom's fish casserole, so I dunno... # #I hate making decisions."
Sam,fall_Thu,Did you ever notice all the spider webs that appear during the fall?# #If you get up early you'll see them covered in dew... like little stars.
Sam,fall_Fri,"I used to live in Zuzu City, you know. The biggest difference is the noise. It's never quiet in the city.# #There's way more people around you, always. And it's always bright with city lights, even at night.# #I guess which setting you like depends on your personality."
Sam,fall_Fri10,"I think I've grown to like the country more than the city. # #Although I could be biased... for a certain reason. 0# #So, how are you doing today? "
Sam,fall_Sat4,I'm lucky to have the biggest room in the house to myself.# #I guess there's advantages to being the oldest child.
Sam,fall_Sat,Hmm. I think I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.# #This happens to me all the time.
Sam,fall_Sun8,"The first week of fall is already over. Man, that went by fast. # #Whatever. I'm just happy that you came to visit me!# #So do you have anything new to tell me?"
Sam,fall_Sun,It's hard to have fun on Sunday... I keep thinking about having to go to work tomorrow. 
Sam,fall_14,Hi @.# #Hmm.. I wonder if I could grow a cactus in my room?
Sam,winter_Mon2,"Everyone's indoors during the winter, so I can play guitar as loud as I want. "
Sam,winter_Mon,"Hi... Cold, isn't it?"
Sam,winter_Tue,"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.# #Take it easy."
Sam,winter_Tue4,"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?# #Well, it's a good time of year to catch up on all the sleep I've missed. "
Sam,winter_Wed," Joja#I hate working at JojaMart, but how else am I going to make money in this town?|I'm glad I work at the museum now. It's way more interesting than that depressing JojaMart ever was."
Sam,winter_Thu6_1,I think my Dad is coming back this spring.# #It's been 3 years since I've seen him. This is going to be strange.
Sam,winter_Thu6,Dad's been back for a while now. I guess I'm finally getting used to it.
Sam,winter_Thu,"My Dad is in the military, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here.# #He's coming back soon, though."
Sam,winter_Thu_2,One thing that's nice about winter... all the mosquitos are gone.
Sam,winter_Fri,The worst thing about the snow is getting your feet soaked. You're lucky in those thick boots.
Sam,winter_Sat4,"I just remembered I need to change the strings on my guitar.# #Okay, I'm going to write a note on my wrist so I remember to do it tonight.# #I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things. "
Sam,winter_Sun8,"It would be fun if we could go sledding, wouldn't it?# #I don't think there are any good hills nearby. # #Plus, I don't have a sled.# #So, how have you been doing lately?"
Sam,winter_Sun,Try not to make a mess in the house or my Mom will flip.
Sebastian,Introduction,"Oh. You just moved in, right? Cool.# #Out of all the places you could live, you chose Pelican Town?"
Sebastian,Resort_Entering,I liked the boat ride. At one point you couldn't see any land at all..
Sebastian,Resort_Leaving,I'm ready to get back home.
Sebastian,Resort,"The beach is nice, but I don't love the crowds."
Sebastian,Resort_Shore,You think Willy would let me lug a jet ski out here?# #...Nah. 
Sebastian,Resort_Wander,"...Now, if I were a tropical frog, where would I hide... "
Sebastian,Resort_Wander_2,I bet this place looks pretty cool in the rain.
Sebastian,Resort_Towel,It's good to get away from the computer and see the real world sometimes. I forget how nice it can be. 
Sebastian,Resort_Bar,"I usually wear black, but in this heat..."
Sebastian,danceRejection,No... There's someone else I want to dance with.
Sebastian,divorced,Why do you keep bothering me? I'm trying to forget about you. 
Sebastian,dumped_Guys,I don't want to see you for a while. 
Sebastian,breakUp,"... alright... # #I guess I'll see you around, then... "
Sebastian,secondChance_Guys,Hey...
Sebastian,Mon,Um... need something?
Sebastian,Mon4,If I just disappeared would it really matter? 
Sebastian,Tue,I was thinking... people are like stones skipping over the water.# #Eventually we're going to sink.
Sebastian,Tue6,I like your new boots! ^Your hair looks nice today. # #Do you want to hang out for a while?
Sebastian,Wed,What am I going to do today?# #Probably nothing.
Sebastian,Wed2,"Sam is probably my only friend in this town.# #Well, Abby is nice too, but... # #Umm.. nevermind."
Sebastian,Wed2_inlaw_Abigail,"Sam is probably my only friend in this town, anymore..."
Sebastian,Wed6,You and Sam are probably my only friends in this town. 
Sebastian,Wed10,"Um... You're single, right?# #Just wondering! "
Sebastian,Thu,"# Sebastian1#I snuck into the caves last night and got a nasty cut from a rock crab. Don't tell anyone, okay?# #Hi.# #...want something?"
Sebastian,Mountain_47_23,I come here for the peace and quiet.
Sebastian,Thu4,"Why does everyone like Maru so much? Sure, she's smart and friendly, but don't they realize it's all just an attention-grabbing scam?# #Sorry... "
Sebastian,Thu6,Could you picture someone like me living on a farm? It seems ridiculous. 
Sebastian,Thu8,"Could you picture me living on a farm?# #It seems ridiculous, but I have been thinking about it lately."
Sebastian,Fri,Uh... I don't really know you.
Sebastian,Fri2, ... If gas wasn't so expensive I'd ride my motorcycle to the city today.# # Fri_old#So what do you do when you aren't working?# 15 0 Fri_bad#More Farming# 16 30 Fri_good#Comic books# 15 -30 Fri_bad#Shopping# 15 -30 Fri_bad#Sports
Sebastian,Fri_old," 16#Hey, if you're bored feel free to hang out in my room... |You probably prefer the small-town life, huh?"
Sebastian,Fri_good,"Oh yeah? Well, did you read the new 'Cave Saga X'? I won't spoil it for you, but oh man... "
Sebastian,Fri_bad,"Oh yea? Hmm... Not really my thing, but everyone's different I guess. "
Sebastian,Sat,What? I didn't hear you... I'm busy thinking about something.# #What do you want?
Sebastian,Sat2,"You know, I should be doing something productive right now. I just lose focus too fast... # #Maybe I should drink more coffee?"
Sebastian,Sun,"Hey. Your name is @, right?"
Sebastian,Sun2,Having a good weekend? ...nice.
Sebastian,Sun4,"I usually stay inside, but I do go to the beach now and then.# #Pretty much only when it's raining, though.# #For some reason, staring off into the bleak horizon makes me feel... I dunno. Like it's worthwhile to keep pushing on, I guess."
Sebastian,Fri8,What's new? # #I'll be at the saloon tonight destroying Sam at pool again. 
Sebastian,Sun10,I was just thinking about you... 
Sebastian,Event_game1,"Okay, that'll work."
Sebastian,Event_game2,Good choice. That works well with my role.
Sebastian,Event_cave1,Not so fast! I want to know what it is.
Sebastian,Event_cave2,Really? It was making a lot of noise!
Sebastian,Event_cave3,It's too dangerous without a sword. But I like your sense of adventure. 
Sebastian,event_garage1,Great. 
Sebastian,event_garage2,Okay... Nevermind then. 
Sebastian,event_garage3,"Don't worry, I'll make sure to show you the ropes before I let you do anything dangerous. ^There's no need to worry... I'll make sure you're safe. "
Sebastian,event_city1,"Hmm... Not exactly how I'd put it but, yeah."
Sebastian,event_city2,"Yea... That's exactly how I feel, too. "
Sebastian,event_city3,"Oh... Well maybe this wasn't the right place to bring you, then. I thought you'd see the beauty in it. "
Sebastian,event_city4,"Ugh... You sound like my Mom. # #... # #You're right, though. I'm addicted to these things, it's not good. "
Sebastian,summer_Mon,Everyone is so happy in the sun. I don't get it.
Sebastian,summer_Mon6,"Everyone is so happy when it's sunny out...# #Different people like different things, I guess."
Sebastian,summer_Tue,"I'm looking forward to the cold, damp season. I feel more at home."
Sebastian,summer_Wed,What's the point of going outside? I've already seen it all.
Sebastian,summer_Wed8,Why am I grinning? I guess I've been unusually happy lately... 
Sebastian,summer_Thu,"I definitely don't want to go swimming, if that's what you're going to ask. # #Oh, you just stopped to say hi? Sorry."
Sebastian,summer_Thu10,If you ever wanted to go swimming... I guess I'd do it. 
Sebastian,summer_Mountain_58_35,# .5#The temperature only starts to get comfortable at night.# #It always seems to stay a little cooler by the lake.
Sebastian,summer_Fri,"Oh, hey. "
Sebastian,summer_Fri6,"Hey, I'm glad you stopped by. # #How have you been coping with this heat?"
Sebastian,summer_Sat,I hope we're not having mushroom casserole tonight... 
Sebastian,spring_12,"I'm not too big on festivals. Lots of commotion, too much social interaction... More stress than fun, if you ask me."
Sebastian,spring_23,Ugh... Tomorrow is the worst festival of the year by a mile. Just wait and see how stupid I look during the flower dance.
Sebastian,fall_20,Are you looking forward to the Spirit's Eve festival? It's probably my favorite. 
Sebastian,fall_26,The Spirit's Eve festival is tomorrow. I really hope they have those skeletons on display again this year. # #I almost feel like they're my friends at this point.
Sebastian,summer_10,Hehe... It might be funny to put something disgusting in the potluck soup tomorrow. Just don't poison anyone.# #Why ruin the potluck? Hmm... I guess some people feel liberated when the rigid structures of society break down a little. Maybe I'm weird.
Sebastian,summer_27,Tomorrow we'll all be gathering at the docks to see the migration of the moonlight jellies. I think it starts at ten o'clock.
Sebastian,winter_24,It's the eve of the winter star today. Better make sure you've got an empty stomach for the feast tomorrow.
Sebastian,summer_Sun,I usually only go outside after dark. Does that sound weird to you?
Sebastian,summer_Sun4,"Last night, I saw a group of bats flying around near the lake.# #I guess maybe they are feeding on the mosquitoes this time of year?"
Sebastian,fall_Mon,"So... it's the big harvest season, isn't it?"
Sebastian,fall_Mon4,"You're probably making a lot of money on your farm, huh?# #I guess I should get a job soon... "
Sebastian,fall_Tue,"Pumpkin spice this... pumpkin spice that... man, I do get sick of these seasonal fads."
Sebastian,fall_Tue6,"Who does Demetrius think he is, telling me what to do? He's not even my real father. "
Sebastian,fall_Wed, ... what time is it? I think I slept too much last night.
Sebastian,fall_Wed8,"I'm glad you showed up. I was starting to get bored.# #Now I feel a lot more energetic, believe it or not."
Sebastian,fall_Thu,My room might be a little less depressing if I had a window... 
Sebastian,fall_Fri," ... I was up until 3 reading this new book...# fall_Fri_old#Do you read, @?# 62 -30 Fri_bad#Yep. The classics.# 63 30 Fri_good#Only Sci-fi and Fantasy# 62 0 Fri_bad#I like a good Romance# 63 -30 Fri_bad#No, I don't read books"
Sebastian,fall_Fri_old, 62#You probably wouldn't like it. |I think you'd like it.
Sebastian,fall_Fri_good,"Hey, me too. There's nothing like a good fiction to push the boundaries of the imagination. "
Sebastian,fall_Fri_bad,Huh. Sounds boring.
Sebastian,fall_Fri6,"I've been reading a book about a farmer. Reminds me a lot of you, actually. # #Sorry if that creeps you out. "
Sebastian,fall_Sat,"I was close to moping in bed the entire day. Kinda wish I had, now."
Sebastian,fall_Sun,The sun is coming out less and less these days... wonderful.
Sebastian,winter_Mon,"I'm enjoying this gloomy weather... although I have to say, it's a little cold."
Sebastian,winter_Mon4,"Nothing surprises me anymore... nothing makes me laugh.# #Yeah, I know... I'm being a little dramatic."
Sebastian,winter_Tue,Hmm... I don't really have anything to say. I still don't know you very well.
Sebastian,winter_Tue4,"Hey...# #It's hard to think of new things to talk about, sometimes. Even after you know someone.# #...Sorry."
Sebastian,winter_Tue6,I was so close to screaming at Mom for throwing away my old comic collection... But something stopped me.# #Hmm... with age comes wisdom.
Sebastian,winter_Tue10,You came here to see me? # #... 
Sebastian,winter_Wed, seems lost in thought...
Sebastian,winter_Wed4,"Hey, don't let me stop you from getting your work done.# #If you aren't busy I don't mind if you stick around. "
Sebastian,winter_Thu,I wonder what's for dinner tonight... 
Sebastian,winter_Thu6,I should learn how to cook. That would be useful.
Sebastian,winter_Fri,It's fun to live so close to the train tracks. It's a reminder that there's a big world out there.
Sebastian,winter_Fri8,When I was younger I'd run out to the railroad whenever I heard a train coming.# #Whatever happened to those days...? 
Sebastian,winter_Sat,The frogs aren't very happy in winter.# #Poor little guys. 
Sebastian,winter_Sat6,"I like winter but I do feel bad for all the cold animals out there.# #I guess they're used to it, though... like me."
Sebastian,winter_Sun,I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it.# #What's his problem? 
Sebastian,winter_Sun6,I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it... yet Maru's cute little snowman goes unharmed! # #Ridiculous.
Shane,Mon,I don't know you. Why are you talking to me?
Shane,Resort_Entering,Buh... hope the bar's open.
Shane,Resort_Leaving,Welp... got my year's supply of Vitamin D. Now I can play video games with the blinds shut the rest of the year.
Shane,Resort_Shore,"That's right... I'm not wearing any shoes or socks.# #Some call it a public health risk.# #The crabs seem to enjoy it, though. "
Shane,Resort_Chair,"Hoo... Feels good to rest these hams.# #If anyone needs me, I'll just be sitting here, marinating."
Shane,Resort_Bar,Phew... feels good to have a cold drink...# #Or maybe a few...
Shane,Resort,"Okay, this sand is piping hot. I regret not wearing shoes. "
Shane,danceRejection,...No. 
Shane,pamHouseUpgrade,"I heard you built Pam a house... That's really generous...# #You know, I could use a hundred thousand gold myself...# # ...ah ...Just kidding. ...Heh."
Shane,pamHouseUpgradeAnonymous,I heard someone bought Pam a house... ... What did Pam ever do to earn that kind of generosity??
Shane,divorced,... # #...Leave me alone. 
Shane,breakUp," Oh... Yeah, okay... I guess I should've seen this coming. # #I'll... uh... guess I'll see you at the Saloon."
Shane,dumped_Guys, has a glazed look in his eye. He won't speak to you.
Shane,secondChance_Guys,I don't understand you... ...
Shane,Mon2,I hardly know you. Why are you talking to me?
Shane,Mon4,Hey. Sorry if I came off as rude when we first met.# #It takes me a while to warm up to strangers.
Shane,Mon10,Do you ever feel like the whole world is scrutinizing you like some disgusting insect?
Shane,Tue,What? What do you want? Go away.
Shane,Tue2,What do you want from me? Money? I'd give you a pot of gold to leave me alone!
Shane,Tue4,Every time I try something new it goes horribly wrong. You learn to just stay in a shell.
Shane,Tue6,Life isn't so bad... at least I have frozen pizza and eggs. 
Shane,Wed,"No, I don't have time to chat with you."
Shane,Wed8,I guess I've grown attached to Marnie and Jas. We're a ragtag bunch but it kind of feels like a weird family.# #I never really had much of a family as a kid. 
Shane,Wed4," Joja# ...Every day is the same. Stocking those horrible shelves, going to the saloon, tossing and turning all night. |I hated my job at JojaMart, but now that I'm unemployed I feel even worse. "
Shane,Thu,What do you want? Leave me alone.
Shane,Thu4,You're really persistent. I guess I'm just surprised that anyone would be interested in talking to me.
Shane,Thu6,Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?
Shane,Thu8,You like talking to me? I guess I believe you... maybe you're as weird as I am. 
Shane,Fri,Don't you have work to do?
Shane,JojaMart, 's hard at work. He doesn't seem interested in talking.
Shane,Fri4," Joja#What's the point of life if all you do is work?|I haven't been able to pay my rent, but Marnie's letting me stay anyway. I'm lucky."
Shane,Fri6,I'll definitely be going to the saloon tonight. What else is there to do?
Shane,Sat,Why are you bothering me? I want to be alone.
Shane,Sat2,# ShaneJOSH#I'm surprised that you're still trying to make friends with me. Haven't I been rude enough to you yet?# # ... 
Shane,Sat4, Joja#I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain.|If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.
Shane,Sat8,I've really grown attached to Marnie's chickens. 
Shane,Sun,"I'm busy, can't you tell?"
Shane,Sun6,...I think I might be gaining weight. 
Shane,Sun8,If I watch more TV maybe I can forget about life. That would be relaxing. 
Shane,Sun10,"Hi, @. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far. "
Shane,Sun4,"Hmm... it's . Should I throw a frozen pizza in the microwave, or should I wait? "
Shane,Sun2,You again? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone? 
Shane,event_room1,Okay... that'll require a great script. Maybe I'll ask Elliott for advice next time I see him at the saloon. 
Shane,event_room2,Sounds great. I'll have to create a bunch of practical effects to make it look cool.
Shane,event_noLoan1,I didn't know you were such a miser... 
Shane,event_noLoan2,"Okay, Dad... ^Okay, Mom... "
Shane,event_noLoan3,"Oh, wow... "
Shane,event_apologize1,"...Yeah, me too."
Shane,event_apologize2,"I know... that's why I stopped by, to tell you about it."
Shane,event_apologize3,"Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..."
Shane,event_stadium1,Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense. # #Me? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes.# #But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out. 
Shane,event_stadium2,"Oh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city? # #I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know."
