Abigail,4,"Oh, hi."
Abigail,Introduction,"It's kind of a shame, really. I always enjoyed exploring those overgrown fields by myself.$9$eOh, that's right... I heard someone new was moving onto that old farm."
Abigail,Resort_Entering,I hope a mermaid visits the beach.
Abigail,Resort_Leaving,I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back.
Abigail,Resort_Leaving_2,Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back.
Abigail,Resort_Shore,"The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!"
Abigail,Resort_Shore_2,"Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways.$h$eHmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island?"
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella,I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy.$eMy skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while.
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella_2,"Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler!$h$eHey @, want to build a sand castle with me?"
Abigail,Resort_Umbrella_3,"I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit.$eHey @, you think you could build a raft?"
Abigail,Resort_Wander,"Relax, I'm just kidding.$h$eQuick, get me a shovel!$eAn island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure."
Abigail,Resort_Bar,"Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great!$h"
Abigail,Resort,And I brought my sword and everything...$s$bBummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach...$s
Abigail,danceRejection,That's flattering... but I'm gonna have to say no. Sorry.
Abigail,divorced,What are you doing here? Just leave me alone!$a
Abigail,dumped_Girls,Don't talk to me!$a
Abigail,secondChance_Girls,"*sigh*... I can't stay mad at you anymore, @. Let's just move on with our lives.$s"
Abigail,breakUp,I guess we weren't really a good match...$s$bOh... I... I understand. You see me as just a friend...$s
Abigail,Mon,"Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?"
Abigail,Mon2,"Do you ever hang out at the cemetery? It's a peaceful place to spend some time alone.$eOh, hi!"
Abigail,Tue,I said I'm not in a good mood... what do you want?$a$eUgh... I'm not in a good mood right now.$s
Abigail,Tue2,"I know my parents mean well, but sometimes they just cannot understand my point of view. Weren't they ever young?$e...*sigh*...$s"
Abigail,Wed,What do you want?$eHey. Sorry in advance if I say anything rude. I didn't get much sleep last night.
Abigail,Thu,"I don't feel like doing anything today...$u$eOh no, I think my Dad's going to cook dinner tonight...$s$1 Abigail1"
Abigail,Fri,"Sometimes I totally lose track of time.$eWow, I just realized it's Friday. $u"
Abigail,Fri2,"We're all going to hang out in the saloon this evening. It's kind of like a friday tradition, I guess."
Abigail,Sat,I wonder if the frogs will make an appearance soon.$eThe fresh mountain air is nice on a day like this.$h
Abigail,Sun,Oh man... I've been pushing off my homework all weekend. Looks like I'll be pulling another all-nighter...$s
Abigail,Sun2,"Nothing. We just cease to exist.$r 17 30 Sun_nothingOur energy bodies enter the astral plane.$r 18 0 Sun_17We go to Heaven.$r 17 0 Sun_17We come back as spooky ghosts.$r 18 40 Sun_18I have no idea.$r 17 0 Sun_17@, What do you think happens to us after we die?$q 17/18 Sun_oldI wonder what would happen if I spent all night in the graveyard?"
Abigail,Sun_old,"I guess you think nothing would happen, right?$u|Maybe a wicked ghost would appear!$p 17"
Abigail,Sun_17,"Hmm, interesting..."
Abigail,Sun_18,Well that's an interesting theory!$h
Abigail,Sun_nothing,"You know, that wouldn't be so bad.$8"
Abigail,Wed2,"Me too. Oh! Nothing physical... just some online classes I'm taking.$eOh, hi @. Taking a break from your work?"
Abigail,Tue4,"I want to take my mind off things for a while... how is your day going?$eHi, I'm glad to see you.$h"
Abigail,Sat6,Interesting. I'd like to go there myself one of these days.$l$eSo have you been exploring the mountain caves at all?$eYou came all this way to visit me? That's nice.$h
Abigail,Mon8,"Want to hang out for a while? Here! Let me read your palm. *giggle* $h$e...Oh, @! Hi.$h"
Abigail,Thu10,"Not in a bad way, though.$h$bDo you feel like everything seems unreal lately?$l$eHi.$l"
Abigail,Fri6,"It's better to be like them, isn't it?$eThe birds were happily chirping today. They're too simple to understand the future."
Abigail,Event_VideoGame_Yes,Great! I'm sure you'll be able to beat this level with ease.$h
Abigail,Event_VideoGame_No,"Oh? *sigh*... I guess I'll never get past this level, then...$s"
Abigail,Event_Grave1,"I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8$bSee? You understand why I'm out here, then."
Abigail,Event_Grave2,"I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8$bSure. I don't want to kill anything, either. I just want to do a little exploring without risking my neck!"
Abigail,Event_Grave3,"I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8$bI'm not some fragile princess.. I can take care of myself!$a$bOh, it's because I'm a girl... isn't it? Ugh...$u^Why? I'm just as strong as you!$a"
Abigail,Event_Grave4,"I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!$8$bReally? That's surprising.$8"
Abigail,Event_Rain_1,I see...$8
Abigail,Event_Rain_2,Yea... I guess you would be one to appreciate this somber ambience.
Abigail,Event_Rain_3,...That's true.$8
Abigail,Event_Tragic_1,Yeah... I guess my own life is okay...$s
Abigail,Event_Tragic_2,...!$h
Abigail,Event_Tragic_3,But I don't.$s$bI would feel better if I could believe that...
Abigail,Event_Cave2_1,@...$8
Abigail,Event_Cave2_2,@... I'm alright.$8
Abigail,Event_Cave_1,...okay.$8
Abigail,Event_Cave_2,"I guess when you have something to lose, it's normal to be afraid...$l"
Abigail,Event_Cave_3,"...Um, okay. Sorry.$9"
Abigail,summer_1,The air is so muggy I feel like I'm floating in soup.$eSummer's here. It's not really my favorite season.
Abigail,summer_Mon,"My pet guinea pig, David, just hates this hot weather. He's fussy."
Abigail,summer_Tue,The air is so thick with honey and nectar all summer. I almost feel dizzy.$u
Abigail,summer_Wed,Have you decorated your house at all? That's what I'd be doing if I had a house.
Abigail,summer_6,"Or maybe that was just a dream I had... It doesn't feel real anymore.$eI went to the beach last night, after dark... Sometimes you can see strange lights bobbing over the sea."
Abigail,summer_Thu,If I knew how to use a sword I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now. It's probably nice and cool in there.
Abigail,summer_Thu4,"Ew, I hope I don't get a tan this summer.$s"
Abigail,summer_Fri,"I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything."
Abigail,summer_Sat,"I'm looking forward to fall... the cool mountain breeze, the swirling red petals, the smell of mushrooms... *sigh*"
Abigail,summer_Sun,"Joja Mega-Mall$r 25 0 Sun_25The old, gnarled forest$r 26 30 Sun_26In a dark cave$r 26 30 Sun_26The beach$r 25 0 Sun_25Okay... pretend you just won a free vacation. Where would you go?$q 25/26 summer_Sun_oldDo you ever get an urge to go exploring, @?"
Abigail,summer_Sun_old,"I do... but you probably wouldn't like the places I'm thinking about...|Maybe we'll be neighbors someday. I think we both have similar, weird tastes.$h$p 25"
Abigail,Sun_25,Huh. I think that would get old fast.
Abigail,Sun_26,Yea! That sounds wonderful.$h
Abigail,summer_Wed2,"The creak of a floorboard, the slow plumes of dust whispering through the rafters... There's something special about an old building, isn't there?$bI would love to live in an old farmhouse like you."
Abigail,summer_Tue4,"You're an interesting guy, @. I'm glad you moved here.$h^You're an interesting lady, @. I'm glad you moved here.$h"
Abigail,summer_Sat6,It's funny how quickly one's outlook can change.$eI'm actually enjoying myself this summer.$h
Abigail,summer_Mon8,"I used to think Pelican Town was kinda drab, but lately I'm starting to love some things about it.$h"
Abigail,summer_Thu10,"I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh...$l$eWow, you look nice today."
Abigail,summer_Fri10,Do you ever get lonely on your farm?
Abigail,fall_1,I was getting so tired of summer.$eAh... Fall's here!$h
Abigail,fall_Mon,I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today.
Abigail,fall_Tue,"I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.|Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop!$h$d joja"
Abigail,fall_Wed,"The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun.$eI can't wait to see some pumpkins this year.$h"
Abigail,fall_Thu,%Abigail doesn't seem to be interested in talking right now.$eLast night I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic %noun. Does that mean anything?$1 AbigailHAND
Abigail,fall_Sat,I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.|Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?$d cc
Abigail,fall_Sun,I like your hair just the way it is!$r 28 0 Sun_28How about bubblegum pink?$r 27 20 Sun_WildColorWhy not blonde?$r 27 10 Sun_27Dye it black.$r 27 10 Sun_27I was thinking about dyeing my hair again... what do you think?$q 27/28 fall_Sun_oldHmm... what should I do tonight?
Abigail,fall_Sun_old,I was going to dye my hair but then I decided against it.|Yes? What is it?$p 27
Abigail,Sun_27,"I'll think about it.$eI guess that's a pretty safe choice, huh?"
Abigail,Sun_28,Of course that's what you'd say.$u
Abigail,Sun_WildColor,You're always good for a laugh.$h
Abigail,fall_Wed2,Save one for me!$h$eAre you growing pumpkins on your farm this year?
Abigail,fall_Tue4,"I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone.$8$bI may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best.$s"
Abigail,fall_Sat6,Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?$eHi.$h
Abigail,fall_Mon8,"But how would that ever happen? *chuckle*$l$eYou know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day..."
Abigail,fall_Thu10,"It was a good dream.$h$eI had an interesting dream last night, with you in it."
Abigail,fall_Fri6,"When the wind really picks up, I almost feel like a kid again.$eI wish the season lasted a little longer.$8"
Abigail,fall_Fri10,"@, what are your plans for the future?$eI usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore.$l"
Abigail,winter_1,"But I like winter, too!$h$eWell, fall is over...$s"
Abigail,winter_Mon,But I do enjoy building a snowgoon.$h$eIt's just too cold to go outside much.
Abigail,winter_Tue,Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?
Abigail,winter_Wed,Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?
Abigail,spring_12,I'm definitely going to enter the egg hunt tomorrow. Are you?
Abigail,spring_23,"Well, tomorrow is the flower dance. Dancing is alright, but they make me wear this stupid white dress...$s"
Abigail,winter_7,I'm looking forward to making a snow man tomorrow.
Abigail,fall_26,Will I see you tomorrow at the Spirit's Eve festival? Look for me in the haunted maze.$h
Abigail,summer_10,"Everyone's excited for the Luau tomorrow. Maybe a little nervous, too, considering the Governor will be here."
Abigail,summer_27,You can't miss tomorrow's festival. It's one of the most beautiful wonders of the valley.
Abigail,winter_24,I'm going to eat so much cranberry sauce tomorrow.$h
Abigail,winter_Thu,"It goes by so fast, doesn't it?$s$eAnother year is almost over."
Abigail,winter_Fri,One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different.
Abigail,winter_Sat,Bye.$eThat means I can play twice as many video games.$h$eIt's the weekend!
Abigail,winter_Sun,"I don't like either of them.$r 29 -50 Sun_BadI like the orc with the battleaxe.$r 30 5 Sun_30I like the jungle island and the tiger.$r 29 20 Sun_29I made these two drawings. What do you think?$q 29/30 winter_Sun_oldOh, hello."
Abigail,winter_Sun_old,Remember those drawings I showed you a while ago? I accidentally threw them away.$s|Remember that drawing I showed you with the orc? I entered it into an online contest and won 50g!$h$p 29
Abigail,Sun_29,Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense.
Abigail,Sun_30,I'm glad. It's embarrassing to share your art with others. But I think you and I are on the same page.
Abigail,Sun_Bad,Rude! Why would you hurt my feelings like that? You're so insensitive!$s
Abigail,winter_Wed2,"As long as I'm not changing, of course!$eHi. If you're ever bored, you can always hang out in my room."
Abigail,winter_Tue4,"It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share.$h"
Abigail,winter_Sat6,...It's a secret.$h$bOh! You want to know what it's about? Well...$u$eI've been daydreaming a lot lately...
Abigail,winter_Thu10,"But this was a really good year, don't you think?$h$bAnother year is almost over..."
Abigail,winter_Wed6,And that means you can hang out with me more often!$h$eIt must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.
Abigail,winter_Fri10,"That's all... *sigh*$s$eIt's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... *gulp*$e@, there's something I want to tell you..."
Alex,Introduction,"I'll see you around.$eOh, hey. So you're the new guy, huh? Cool.^Hey, you're the new girl, huh? I think we're going to get along great. I'm Alex."
Alex,Resort_Entering,"Finally, we're here!"
Alex,Resort_Leaving,Aw... I guess it can't last forever.$s
Alex,Resort_Wander,I knew I shoulda brought a frisbee... Oh well.$h
Alex,Resort_Wander_2,"Don't worry, I'll go easy!$h$eI wonder if anyone would be up for a volleyball tournament."
Alex,Resort_Shore,"... Don't worry, I'm not going to try it.$h$bI'm guessing at least a mile.$eI wonder how far I could swim out, and still make it back?"
Alex,Resort_Chair,"Aren't you hot in that outfit? C'mon, man... It's the beach!^Aren't you hot in that outfit? You gotta get some ocean breeze goin'!"
Alex,Resort_Towel,"With this island open, there's no excuse to be pasty anymore!"
Alex,Resort_Towel_2,"Kind of a shame to have them hidden away all the time back home.$ePhew, it feels good to finally get these abs a little sunlight."
Alex,Resort_Towel_3,"But for now, this place will do just fine!$h$eWhen I go pro, I'll vacation on islands all around the world."
Alex,Resort_Bar,I'm ordering a banana shake with two scoops of protein powder.
Alex,Resort,Ah... The island life. I could get used to this!
Alex,danceRejection,Nah... I'm gonna ask someone else. Good luck.
Alex,divorced,I thought we had something special... I guess I was wrong.$s
Alex,dumped_Guys,You're not worth my time.$a
Alex,secondChance_Guys,"I don't know if I can trust you anymore, but I'm willing to give you a chance.$9"
Alex,breakUp,"*huff*... Got it. Alright... well, you've made your choice. You're not gonna see me begging.$a$bYou're giving me wha...?$7"
Alex,Mon,See this little star on my jacket here? That proves it.$eDid you know I was an all-star quarterback in high school? It's true.$u
Alex,Tue,"*sigh*... I wish there were more girls in this town, know what I mean?$s^Hey, do you wanna hang out with me at the beach some time? Do you have a bikini?$eYou gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale.eThe beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays."
Alex,Wed,"(angry) What's that supposed to mean?$r 5 0 Wed_01_03I want to play catch with you!$r 5 15 Wed_01_01I'm fine just watching you from a distance.$r 6 0 Wed_01_02I'd ask you to throw the ball around, but you don't really seem like the sports type.^If you weren't a girl I'd ask you to play catch.$q 5/6 Wed_01_old$eLooks like a good day to play catch, huh?$u"
Alex,Wed_01_old,Go long! ...just kidding. Hahaha.|I just wish I had someone to play catch with...$s$p 5
Alex,Wed_01_01,"My arm's a little sore, but maybe next time.$bReally? I guess I underestimated you."
Alex,Wed_01_02,"Yeah, some people just aren't made for sports."
Alex,Wed_01_03,Uh... nevermind.
Alex,Thu,The air's starting to warm up... I'm feeling pumped.
Alex,Fri,"Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?eOh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups!eHey, what's up farmer guy?^Hey, it's farm girl. Did you get new pants? You're doing something right."
Alex,Sat,"I must've done a thousand push-ups yesterday.eMy arms are really sore, but that's the sign of progress for a guy like me."
Alex,Sun,"What, you wanna talk to me? I'm busy.$eHey."
Alex,Sun2,"That's right, I remember your name.$eHey, @."
Alex,Sun4,"How's your day going?$eHey, @."
Alex,Fri4,"Just kidding.$h$eNow Grandpa, on the other hand...$eI'm not ashamed to say that I love my Grandma!eHey, @. I'm glad you stopped by."
Alex,Tue6,Nothing's better than an energetic day at the beach with your friends... right?
Alex,Mon8,"I still want to go pro, but it's not the most important thing in the world.$eYou know, I used to want fame and fortune, but lately I've been starting to sing a different tune. In the end it's the humble little things that satisfy, don't you think?"
Alex,Fri8,Hi @. You look sporty today.$h^Hey @. Did you do something different with your hair? Something keeps grabbing my attention.$h
Alex,Sat10,I've been having a hard time staying focused lately.$l
Alex,Event_beach1,Of course you do. If you didn't I'd think you were crazy. Or some kind of nerd.
Alex,Event_beach2,Sorry.$bReally? You must be some kind of weirdo.$a
Alex,Event_books1,"No, I'm not! You're just trying to flatter me.$a"
Alex,Event_books2,"Yeah, I guess you're right...$s"
Alex,Event_books3,You were supposed to disagree with me.$a
Alex,event_box1,Make it or not... As long as I try my hardest I think she'd be proud. Thanks.$bYes... I know. That's why I've been so determined to be successful with my sports stuff...$9
Alex,event_box2,Wow... It's the anniversary of my Mom's death! Have a heart...$a
Alex,event_box3,"I'm glad.^Is that embarrassing to say?$l$bYou... you're different than the other guys. More sensitive.$l^You've become my best friend in the whole town... $b...Thanks, @."
Alex,event_box4,"That doesn't make me feel any better, jerk.$a"
Alex,Event_parents1,That's an interesting thought...
Alex,Event_parents2,They would never do that!$a
Alex,Event_parents3,...Maybe you're right... I dunno.$s
Alex,summer_1,Right now is great because we've got the whole season to look forward to. Catch you later.$eHey. Summer is definitely the best time of year.
Alex,summer_Mon,"Then you'd be able to say you knew me once. Cool, huh?$eThe more I practice this summer, the easier it'll be for me to go pro.$eHey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt.^Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going.$h"
Alex,summer_Tue,"*sigh*... Life can be tough.$eIf my hair wasn't so popular with the ladies, I swear I'd shave it all off in a second."
Alex,summer_Wed,"No, you'll most likely fail and become a salesman$r 53 -50 summer_Wed_01_03Maybe, if you practice a lot$r 52 0 summer_Wed_01_02You're destined to be a sports legend$r 52 30 summer_Wed_01_01Do you think I'll ever turn pro?$q 52/53 summer_Wed_01_old$bHey farm guy, I've got a question for you.^Hey Farm girl, I've got a question for you."
Alex,summer_Wed_01_old,"Hey, when I turn pro you can say you were my first ""fan"". Not bad, huh?|Hey, I've been practicing twice as hard so I can turn pro and prove you wrong. You just wait.$a$p 52"
Alex,summer_Wed_01_01,"You're cooler than I thought.$eHey, now that's what I'm talking about!$h"
Alex,summer_Wed_01_02,"Yeah, well I'm so good I'm not going to have to practice all that much.$u"
Alex,summer_Wed_01_03,"Get away from me.$a$eThat's insane. You're just jealous that I'm talented and popular and you're not.$a^That's ridiculous. You're just jealous that I'm way more popular than you'll ever be, freak.$a"
Alex,summer_Thu,"Why do you have that look on your face?$eMaybe you'll reach my level some day. Something to look forward to, huh?$eHey, you must be getting pretty strong working on that farm all day.^Hey, you must be getting pretty fit working on that farm all day."
Alex,summer_Fri,I've got more important things to do right now.$eWhat do you want?
Alex,summer_Sat,Damn I could go for a burger.$eMmmm... I smell a barbeque.
Alex,summer_Sun,"...What?$a$eI just threw them into the garbage. I would've donated them but I don't like the idea of some weirdo wearing my shoes, ya know?$bI got these new shoes yesterday 'cuz my old pair had a brown smudge."
Alex,summer_Sun4,"Different people have different tastes I guess.$eOh wow...your shoes are a little dirty... but that's fine, too!"
Alex,summer_Thu4,"All that farm work is paying off, huh?$bHey, you look like you're getting into some good shape this summer!"
Alex,summer_Mon4,"Hey, nice tan."
Alex,summer_Fri6,"It's just hard to always remember to clean. I'm trying to get better, though.$eSorry my room is so messy.$s"
Alex,summer_Wed8,"I like being outdoors and doing things with my hands.$eYou know, I actually wouldn't mind being a farmer... it seems a lot like playing sports, in a way."
Alex,summer_Sat10,I've been trying to do more reading lately... I feel like I've been neglecting my brain for years because of my athletic obsession.
Alex,fall_1,"That's all I care about.$eSure, it's getting colder... But it's still warm enough for sports!"
Alex,fall_Mon,"Studying is for nerds, anyway.$eI was like, '...Grams, don't fret. I'm turning pro!'$h$eMy Grandma told me I should spend more time studying."
Alex,fall_Wed,"It looks like some kind of fungal growth.$r 55 -30 fall_Wed_01_02It looks very fashionable.$r 54 30 fall_Wed_01_01Do you think the ladies like my haircut?^What do you think about my haircut?$q 54/55 fall_Wed_01_old$eHey, I want to ask you something.^Hey, can I ask you something?"
Alex,fall_Wed_01_old,...what?$eDon't touch it!$eI put too much gel in my hair today. It kind of hurts.
Alex,fall_Wed_01_01,"Yeah, I know. That's why I have it like this."
Alex,fall_Wed_01_02,Yeah right. You're just jealous that I look so good.
Alex,fall_Thu,"Oh. It's @? Okay. Sorry.$eIsn't your name, like, %firstnameletter%name, or something?$eWhat's up?"
Alex,fall_Fri,"Need anything else?$eI'm pretty dedicated, aren't I?$h$bI'm going to do two hundred sit-ups tonight."
Alex,fall_Sat,At least that's what I heard.$eI think you can find salmon in the river this time of year.
Alex,fall_Sun,"Sundays are pretty awesome in the fall.$ueHey, the gridball game is on today!"
Alex,fall_Thu2,"What's up, @?"
Alex,fall_Fri6,You have to work really hard if you want to achieve your maximum potential.$eI'm going to do a ton of sit-ups tonight.
Alex,fall_Mon4,Maybe she's right...$s$eMy Grandma told me I should spend more time studying.
Alex,fall_Wed8,I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who only liked me because I have gel in my hair.$eI finally took the plunge... I've decided to stop putting gel in my hair.
Alex,fall_Thu10,@! Um... Hi.$l
Alex,winter_1,I guess some people like it.$eWinter is kind of lame. There's too much snow to do anything fun.
Alex,winter_Mon,You like the snow? Me... I'm just looking forward to spring.
Alex,winter_Tue,"Hey, can you go find Haley and tell her I said 'hi'?"
Alex,winter_Tue_inlaw_Haley,"Oh, hey. How's the married life coming along?$9"
Alex,winter_Wed,"Maybe if I read a book I'd be less bored... nah.$ePeople stay indoors a lot during the winter, and do boring stuff.$s"
Alex,winter_Thu,"Then I won't have to deal with these boring winters.$eWhen I turn pro, I'll be so rich that I'll get a vacation home in the tropics."
Alex,winter_Fri,I guess that makes sense.$eYou came all the way through the snow to see me?
Alex,winter_Sat,I don't get it.$e...like that guy Sebastian. Why does he wear black all the time?$eThere's some weird people living in this town.
Alex,winter_Sun,"This might be my favorite day of the week.eHey, the gridball game is on today!"
Alex,winter_Fri4,That's nice of you.$h$eYou came all the way through the snow to see me?
Alex,winter_Sat6,"I don't always understand why others act the way they do, but that's fine.$bI guess it's interesting that some people are totally different than us, you know?"
Alex,winter_Tue4,"Thanks.$eIf you see Haley, tell her I'm busy.$l$bHey, @. Could you do me a favor?$l"
Alex,winter_Tue4_inlaw_Haley,"I'll admit... I was a little jealous when you and Haley got married. But, hey... It's a chance for me to learn something new about myself.$9"
Alex,winter_Wed8,You know what? I'm going to start reading a book!
Alex,winter_Thu6,I wish I could control the weather.
Alex,winter_Thu10,"That means you, too.$h$eIf I ever make a lot of money, I'll make sure all my friends and family are taken care of."
Elliott,Introduction,"I'm Elliott... I live in the little cabin by the beach. It's a pleasure to meet you.$bAh, the new farmer we've all been expecting... and whose arrival has sparked many a conversation!"
Elliott,Resort_Entering,That was quite the ride!
Elliott,Resort_Leaving,I'll see you back in the valley.
Elliott,Resort_Leaving_2,Hmmm... Perhaps this could make for an interesting novel...$eImagine crawling out of a pocket and finding yourself on a beach hundreds of miles from home!$h$bHopefully a crab hasn't snuck onto my clothes again.$s
Elliott,Resort_Chair,I'm just taking a quick break to slather some coconut oil on my body.$h
Elliott,Resort_Bar,"Heh heh... Never mind!$b*hic*... Oh... I don't have the G.$s$bGus, I'll order a round for everyone!"
Elliott,Resort_Wander,I've heard rumors of pirates coming to shore near here at night. They say it can get pretty wild!
Elliott,Resort,"I must admit, this beach blows my own humble strand out of the water."
Elliott,Resort_2,That's the trouble with relaxing on the beach.$eOh dear! Some seaweed has tangled itself in my hair.
Elliott,danceRejection,Excuse me... not today.$s
Elliott,divorced,Why do you torment me? Can't you see you've shattered all my hopes and dreams?$s$e...$s
Elliott,dumped_Guys,Go away. I can't bear to see you.$s
Elliott,secondChance_Guys,You've hurt me beyond measure... but I'm willing to leave the past behind us.$s
Elliott,breakUp,I suppose there are other horizons to set my eyes upon...$s$bAh... the wilted bouquet. A sight I'd hoped to never see...$s
Elliott,Mon,"I moved here only a year before you.$eI'm kind of new to this town myself, but I really feel at home.$h"
Elliott,Mon4,I hope you've come to think of this place as 'home'.
Elliott,Tue,"Well, I really must get back to my work.$eA great idea can pass through your head when you least expect it... but if your mind is too busy you might miss it."
Elliott,Tue6,"That's why I chose this beach as my home, so that I could have peace and quiet to do my work.$bThe sweet friction of pen and paper is the music of my soul.$u"
Elliott,Wed,The forest is a wonderful place. Have you been there?
Elliott,Wed8,"I don't want to grow old as a lonely hermit on this beach...$s$eI wish there was more certainty about the future.$s$eSorry, I'm feeling morose today.$s"
Elliott,Thu2,I can't seem to find the inspiration to begin writing my novel...$s
Elliott,Thu4,I've been feeling hopeful lately. Perhaps the weather is changing.
Elliott,Thu6,"No, no... I'm not fishing for compliments. Though they are appreciated...$eSometimes I wonder if I might just have an inflated self-image and no real skills...$s"
Elliott,Thu8,It feels good to have a close friend like you.$eIt's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend.$k$1 elliottApol
Elliott,Thu,"Are you well?$eHello, @."
Elliott,Fri,A quick stroll outdoors always invigorates me.$eThe fresh air of this valley is good for body and mind.
Elliott,Fri4,Ah... do not get too close to my hair with a torch...$8
Elliott,Fri8,I'll admit... it takes me several hours each morning to make my hair look this good.
Elliott,Sat,You probably wouldn't like it inside my cabin. It's dark and full of spiders.$s
Elliott,Sat4,Please excuse the sorry state of my cabin.
Elliott,Sat6,"Everyone likes to have friends, even that grumpy blacksmith.$eSome people are shy. Keep showing interest in them and they'll get comfortable around you."
Elliott,Sun,Hello. I hope your new farming life is panning out as you'd hoped?
Elliott,Sun6,"It's always a pleasure to see you.$h$eOh, @! I was hoping you'd show up."
Elliott,event_idea1,"Mystery, huh? It's definitely an exciting genre. I'll remember that."
Elliott,event_idea2,"Ah, one of the classic genres. I'll remember that."
Elliott,event_idea3,I'll remember that.$bI would've never guessed! I suppose even those of the 'earthiest' profession sometimes have their heads in the stars.$h
Elliott,event_boat1,... I was worried you might not feel this way about another man.$l^So am I.$l
Elliott,event_boat2,Oh! I'm so sorry.$8%fork
Elliott,event_toast1,Here's to @!$bWell...okay.
Elliott,event_toast2,Here's to us!$bThat's a great idea!$h
Elliott,event_toast3,Hmmph...forget it.$a
Elliott,event_toast4,"Here's to Pelican Town!$bAh, to a harmonious future for the community... what a virtuous idea."
Elliott,summer_Mon,I'm sorry if that isn't very interesting to you.$eA gentle little sunbeam woke me up this morning. I've never felt so refreshed.$u
Elliott,summer_Mon4,I hope you don't mind.$h$eI know that I am kind of an 'oddball'.
Elliott,summer_Mon6,"@, I know you have faith in my abilities as a writer. That means a lot to me.$h"
Elliott,summer_Tue,I would imagine the rarer varieties to be quite valuable.$eI've encountered some beautiful shells in front of my house.
Elliott,summer_Tue6,"*sigh*...times are changing, though. People don't read anymore.$s$eI write in hopes of connecting with others through time and space.$u"
Elliott,summer_Wed,It's as if your essence is infused into the fruit.$u$eIt must be satisfying to follow your crop from seed to harvest.
Elliott,summer_Thu,That's the trouble with living on the beach.$eOh dear! My shoes are filled with sand.$s
Elliott,summer_Fri,I guess the hot summer air can make us a little dizzy.$b@? You look puzzled.
Elliott,summer_Sat,"The sun is angry today... My skin is a bit too delicate, I'm afraid."
Elliott,summer_Sun,You came all the way here just to talk to me? How kind.$h
Elliott,summer_Sun4,Visit my cabin whenever you like. I could use the company.$h
Elliott,fall_Mon,Make sure and take breaks from your work now and then.$eHello @.
Elliott,fall_Mon4,I'm usually at my house.$eCome visit me if you need a break from your labors.$h
Elliott,fall_Tue,"It's been said that a pirate's ship, full of plundered gold, shipwrecked here a long time ago."
Elliott,fall_Tue8,"So! Tell me about your day.$eMaybe you sensed it.$h$e@, I was just thinking about you.$l"
Elliott,fall_Wed8,"The quiet atmosphere of a farm might be a good source of literary inspiration, don't you think?$h$eI wouldn't mind trying my hand at farming."
Elliott,fall_Thu,That's the trouble with living on the beach.$eOh dear! A tiny crab appears to have made his home in my shirt pocket.$l
Elliott,fall_Fri4,"Sometimes I envy you, @.$eMy legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all night.$s"
Elliott,fall_Fri,My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all morning.$s
Elliott,fall_Fri10,"I know... strange, but it's true.$e@, when you're around... I feel unusually creative.$l"
Elliott,fall_Sat,It gets windy this time of year. Marvelous!$h
Elliott,fall_Sun,I have to remember to water my plants today. And not with sea water this time!
Elliott,winter_Mon,I could do with a respite from my lonely labors.$eYou've come to visit me in the cold?
Elliott,winter_Mon4,"I'm honored!$h$e@, you've trudged through the snow to visit me?"
Elliott,winter_Tue,I just go to the grocery store.$s$ePeople have scraped a living off the sea for thousands of years.
Elliott,winter_Tue10,"Perhaps we're connected by an other-worldly thread.$l$e@, I had a feeling that you would show up."
Elliott,-winter_Wed,"Sorry, am I babbling on about nonsense?$eA day can never be boring when you follow the whims of your imagination.$u"
Elliott,winter_Thu,How does it make you feel?$eBreathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea.
Elliott,winter_Thu6,"Whenever I smell the sea, it reminds me of my youth. The ocean really impressed me as a child.$eBreathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea."
Elliott,winter_Fri,"I suppose I am too vain.$eI'm surprised I haven't just shaved it off in a fit of passion.$h$eIt's a lot of work.$eI have to brush my hair daily, or else it'll clump up into messy knots."
Elliott,winter_Sat,"Sorry if it's a little humid in the cabin.$s$eI've been doing little indoor exercises, since it's often too cold to go out."
Elliott,winter_Sun,Do you make time for cleaning?$eI really should scrub my floorboards today. I think an algae is starting to form.$s
Emily,Introduction,"If you're ever looking for something to do in the evening, stop by the saloon. That's where I work!$bOoh!... I can read it on your face. You're going to love it here in Pelican Town."
Emily,Resort_Entering,"Oh, I like this place! It's full of parrots!"
Emily,Resort_Leaving,Ah... my lungs feel perfect.
Emily,Resort_Shore,Can you feel it? The ocean has a profound healing energy.
Emily,Resort_Chair,"Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!"
Emily,Resort_Bar,It's nice to be on this side of the bar for once!$h
Emily,Resort,"If you open your heart to the sun, you can feel a loving energy inside of you.$h"
Emily,Resort_Dance,%Emily is lost in the music.
Emily,danceRejection,I'm very sorry... but I've already agreed to dance with someone else.$u
Emily,divorced,"Please, let me try to heal...$s$e@... You broke my heart... I just can't talk to you anymore.$s"
Emily,dumped_Girls,...$s
Emily,breakUp,B...But I thought we had a special bond... *sniff*$s
Emily,reject_866,"Oh, that's beautiful... I have a friend who would love that! But she lives far from here..."
Emily,secondChance_Girls,@... I'm ready to give you a second chance. I still have faith that there's a good person inside of you.$s
Emily,Mon,"Have I told you Haley and I are sisters? Strange, isn't it?"
Emily,Mon2,"Maybe I'll show you some day.$h$eI have a secret hobby, but I won't say any more."
Emily,Mon4,"I can see it in your eyes... you believe in the other world, like me.$eThis world is full of spirits and magic... Some don't believe me, but I know it's true."
Emily,Mon6,I think she's hoping to marry someone rich.$u$eI wish Haley would get a job or at least contribute to cooking and cleaning.$s
Emily,Mon6_inlaw_Haley,"I have to say, now that Haley's gone I've had a much easier time keeping things in order."
Emily,Mon8,"Working in the saloon, I hear first-hand about everyone's problems.$u$eThere's good people in this town who just can't seem to find happiness. It makes me sad.$u"
Emily,Tue,I work part-time at Gus' saloon. It pays the bills.
Emily,Tue4,"I made these clothes from scratch, see?$eI'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring.$u"
Emily,Tue6,"Oh, hi... It's nice of you to visit me like this.$h"
Emily,Tue8,"You know, @... I think the future looks bright for both of us."
Emily,Wed,"I've heard rumors of rare and powerful magic rings, forged long ago by forgotten civilizations. I'm not sure if it's true or just a fairy tale."
Emily,Wed4,"Every critter deserves our respect, even the slimy ones.$eYou catch fish? I just hope you treat the poor things humanely.$s"
Emily,Wed6,Have faith... every day you're taking one more step on the path of your destiny.
Emily,Wed8,"I always knew we'd become close like this...$eHi, @.$u"
Emily,Thu,How do I know? I have a strong gut-feeling!$eI hope you're farming in a sustainable way. The valley's ecosystem is fragile!
Emily,Thu4,Sometimes the flowers speak to me... each one has a different story to tell!
Emily,Fri,"Oh, excuse me! I was mumbling about fashion again, wasn't I?$bAh, spring. The season of pastels. I actually prefer jewel tones, myself."
Emily,Sat,"And it's such a long trip to the city.$eI like making my own clothes, but it's not easy to get cloth."
Emily,Sat6,"Do you ever think about the texture of fabric, @? Each texture has a distinct personality... feel my dress... see?"
Emily,Sun,"You'll need a loom, though. You can make them yourself if you know the crafting recipe.$eDo you raise sheep in your barn? You can turn their wool into beautiful bolts of cloth!$eHi @!"
Emily,Sun4,"I enjoy living here, though. It's a beautiful area and the town is nice.$eWe have no idea when they'll be back.$eThis house was left in our care by my parents. They've been traveling the world for the last two years."
Emily,event_dance1,Thank you!
Emily,event_dance2,Um... Okay. Sorry you didn't like it. I guess those three years of practice were a complete waste...$s
Emily,event_dance3,I'm so glad you liked it.$bDid you really think so? That's exactly the effect I was shooting for!$h
Emily,summer_Mon,Haley is a picky eater. It's so hard to cook for her.
Emily,summer_Mon4,Eating healthy is very important to me. I want to live a long and active life.
Emily,summer_Mon_inlaw_Haley,Haley and I get along much better now that she's moved out. I look forward to her visits!
Emily,summer_Tue,"I feel lazy today.$u$eHello there, @."
Emily,summer_Tue6,"I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others.$eI feel bad for Linus. People judge him, but he's just living a different lifestyle.$u"
Emily,summer_Sun6,"That's fine with me. You're a cool guy.^I'm glad.$h$eHi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we?$h"
Emily,summer_Sun8,"This may sound weird, but I've always been certain this would happen.$eHi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we?$h"
Emily,summer_Wed,"Or do you enjoy the sunny weather?$eThat just means more watering work for you, huh?$eIt doesn't rain much in summer, does it?"
Emily,summer_Thu,I consider the bees and butterflies to be my special friends!
Emily,summer_Fri,But Gus would be upset if I had another job...$s$eIf I wasn't so busy I'd come help you on the farm!
Emily,summer_Fri6,"There's so much out there, I can't stay a barmaid forever.$u$bYou know, I'm sure Gus would understand if I wanted to leave the Saloon someday."
Emily,summer_Sat,Don't overwork yourself or you might end up in Harvey's clinic!
Emily,summer_Sun,Hi @!
Emily,summer_Sun4,It's around this time of year that my good friends visit the region... I mean the parrots!
Emily,fall_1,"Well, fall is here. Time to plant some new crops, huh?"
Emily,fall_Mon,"It's good weather for a picnic, isn't it?"
Emily,fall_Mon8,If I didn't have to work I'd suggest we go on a nice picnic!
Emily,fall_Tue,Hello. Did you have a good summer?
Emily,fall_Tue4,"You're an excellent farmer.$h$eHi @! I bet your farm did great this past summer, huh?"
Emily,fall_Wed,I think she sells some rare products.$eMy friend runs a shop in the desert. If you ever go there stop in and say hi for me.
Emily,fall_Thu,"He gets lonely working in his shop all day. But he's so shy he has trouble making new friends.$eAre you friends with Clint? He's a nice guy, if you get to know him."
Emily,fall_Thu8,I always thought we were friends.$u$eI think Clint's mad at me. He never looks at me anymore...$u
Emily,fall_Fri,It's a pity it'll soon be over.$eAnother beautiful fall day.
Emily,fall_Fri6,"I just fear that the Joja Co.'s of the world will take this away from us.$u$bSmell that clean air? It's lovely, isn't it?"
Emily,fall_Sat,"Anyway, how is your day going?$eKeep your mind open and some interesting things might take root."
Emily,fall_Sat6,I don't have any huge plans for life. I prefer not to stress about the future.
Emily,fall_Sun,Nothing like a sunny sunday to lift the spirits!
Emily,fall_Sun6,"Me? Well, you know what they say... 'You can't cage a wild Junimo'.$eThere's so many invisible barriers holding us back. Why can't people learn to let go and celebrate freedom?"
Emily,fall_Sun10,"You're such a nice person, @! Thanks for being my friend.$h"
Emily,winter_Mon,Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head!
Emily,winter_Mon10,Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head! I wouldn't want you to get hurt!
Emily,winter_Tue,"You must be getting very good at farming by now, huh?$eOh, hello @!$h"
Emily,winter_Tue2,I bet you're an excellent farmer by now!
Emily,winter_Tue4,I think my hair is frozen solid...$s
Emily,winter_Wed,Your farmhouse seems nice and cozy.$h$eAh well. I really shouldn't be complaining.$eHaley and I aren't made for such a big house. It's a hassle to keep it clean.
Emily,winter_Thu,I wonder if any fish hibernate? Maybe I should ask Demetrius.$eIt must be so cold for the poor fish.$s
Emily,winter_Fri,I bet there are some powerful crystals inside there.$eIf I wasn't so busy I'd help you dig around in that cave by the lake.
Emily,winter_Sat,"It's hard to get fresh ingredients in the winter, huh?$eI like that dish quite a bit.$h%revealtasteEmily207$eDo you know how to cook 'Bean Hotpot'?"
Emily,winter_Sun,...Yes?$eHi!
Emily,winter_Sun6,"So, is there anything you want to talk about?$eI think she'll become a very nice young lady some day... Don't tell her I said that.$h$eMy sister and I might fight sometimes, but I would really miss her if she left."
Emily,winter_Sun6_inlaw_Haley,Say hi to my sister for me! And remind her to visit me tomorrow.
Haley,Introduction,"Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be cute.^Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be pretty... Actually, nevermind.$h$eHuh? Oh... I'm Haley.$eOh... you're that new farmer boy, aren't you?^Oh... You're that new farmer girl, or whatever. Aren't you?"
Haley,Resort_Entering,I saw a dolphin on the way in!
Haley,Resort_Leaving,There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good.
Haley,Resort_Shore,It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?
Haley,Resort_Shore_2,"I have to remember to bring my camera next time.$eI bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo.$bWow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon!$h"
Haley,Resort_Towel,It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right.$h$eGetting the perfect tan is an artform...
Haley,Resort_Towel_2,But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either!$h$e*sigh* I think I've finally found my place in the universe.$bLaying out on a tropical beach.
Haley,Resort_Towel_3,"City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it?$h$eEmily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City."
Haley,Resort_Chair,I painted my toenails blue to match the sea. What do you think? *wiggle* *wiggle*$h
Haley,Resort_Bar,"Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me!$h"
Haley,Resort,This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!
Haley,danceRejection,Ew... No.
Haley,divorced,Why are you still clinging to me? Go live your own life.$7$eThanks for the memories.$7$eI'll be fine on my own...$7
Haley,breakUp,"Oh... hmph. Beat me to it, huh? Alright...$bAgh!$8"
Haley,dumped_Girls,I've got nothing to say to you!$a
Haley,secondChance_Girls,"Alright, alright... I'm done giving you the cold shoulder. Just promise me you'll never, ever lie to me again.$s"
Haley,Mon,"What?$eThat's why I usually just order online.$eI have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes.$s$eThis town is so small. It sucks.$u"
Haley,Tue,I'm bored.$eAre those made out of plastic?^Or wait... Are you even wearing any?$bNice shoes.^Nice makeup.
Haley,Wed,The only thing I like about this town is the beach.$u
Haley,Thu,Do you need something?$e*sigh* I could really go for a cupcake right now.$eI've decided I am going to organize my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!$1 HaleyClothes
Haley,Fri,%Haley is ignoring you.
Haley,Fri2,"You probably get a nice tan, though.$eI couldn't stand getting all dirty like that.$eDon't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do?"
Haley,Sat,I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here.
Haley,Sun,My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related.$u
Haley,Wed8,The other one is a secret! *giggle*$h$eOne of them is the beach.$bThere are only two things I like about this town.
Haley,Tue2,"This isn't the best time of year for shells, though.$eI wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning?"
Haley,Wed4,Those pink ones smell so good.$h$eI'm glad that the flowers are starting to bloom.
Haley,Fri6,Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?$eI've decided I want to expand my horizons.$eI need to find some kind of hobby other than shopping.
Haley,Mon6,"If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community.$eI used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it."
Haley,Thu6,But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen...$eI cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay!
Haley,Sun6,I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes.
Haley,Sat8,"You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever.$eYesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing.$k$s$1 haleySeagull"

Harvey,Introduction,"I hope you'll find your own work equally rewarding, in time.$h$eI perform regular check-ups and medical procedures for all the residents of Pelican Town. It's rewarding work.$eIt's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Harvey, the local doctor."
Harvey,Resort_Entering,Sun hat? Check...$bSunscreen? Check...
Harvey,Resort_Leaving,"If you get burnt, a little aloe vera cream might help soothe the skin."
Harvey,Resort_Shore,I combed the whole beach for glass. We wouldn't want anyone to get a cut on their foot!
Harvey,Resort_Chair,The trouble is actually letting go of your worries...$s$bIt's nice to have an opportunity to relax now and then.
Harvey,Resort_Bar,It's important to stay hydrated in this heat. I'm going to ask Gus if he has any coconut water!$h
Harvey,Resort,I'll let you in on a little secret... I can only swim with floaties.$s
Harvey,danceRejection,"Oh! I'm sorry... I, er... have plans to ask someone else.$s"
Harvey,divorced,I... I can't look at you. Please spare me any more pain.$s
Harvey,breakUp,*gulp*... I... I think I'm going to be sick...$s$b...Y...You...?$s
Harvey,dumped_Guys,I'm busy with my work. I can't speak to you.$s
Harvey,secondChance_Guys,"I want you back in my life, @. I'm willing to forget what happened.$s"
Harvey,Mon,I know that being a farmer is pretty tiring work... don't overdo it!$bWe sell a few over-the-counter medicines at the clinic... feel free to stop by if you're feeling exhausted.
Harvey,Mon2,"It's a pretty small community, and I'm fortunate to be able to build a good relationship with my patients.$eI feel responsible for the health of this whole community... it's kind of stressful."
Harvey,Mon6,It feels good to know that you're useful.$eI'd like to stay in Stardew Valley for a while. I'm finally starting to feel involved in the community.
Harvey,Mon10,"Do you... have any medical questions?$l$eOh! Hi, @.$l"
Harvey,Tue,"You're young, though. You'll probably stay healthy without trying.$h$eFeel free to stop by my office if you're ever feeling ill."
Harvey,Tue8,"Your health is important to me.$l$eDon't overwork yourself, @. Doctor's orders!"
Harvey,Wed4,"I'd like to get to know you better, @. Let's put aside our doctor-patient relationship."
Harvey,Wed6,It's nice to have a friend in town.$h
Harvey,Wed8,You have a really healthy glow. That's good.$h
Harvey,Wed,Then make sure to wash your hands.$eRemember to cover your mouth when you sneeze.
Harvey,Thu8,"If I didn't live alone I think it would be easier.$l$eIt's a lot of work, being a doctor. I don't eat as well as I should.$s"
Harvey,Thu,"Home-cooked meals are best. Do you cook?$eNutrition is important, so make sure and eat well. Try to increase your vegetable intake!"
Harvey,Fri,"I wish I had less work to do.$s$eIt's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
Harvey,Fri4,"If you want to hang out in my apartment, that's okay with me. I live above the clinic."
Harvey,Fri10,Stop by my place if you ever need a confidential check-up.$l
Harvey,Sat,Take care.$eCan I do anything for you?
Harvey,Sat4,"I've grown to really love it.$h$eI came here because I liked the small-town atmosphere, and the potential for a holistic approach to patient care."
Harvey,Sat8,I think I'll stay younger with you around.$l$eThe older you get the more memories you're burdened with. It can be overwhelming.$s$e*Sigh*... I'm starting to feel kind of old...
Harvey,Sun,I guess I should try to get patients from the neighboring towns...$eHmm... I'm struggling to make ends meet. I don't have enough patients.
Harvey,Sun6,"Imagine having a patient's life completely in your hands, and failing to keep them alive... that's something that will haunt you forever.$s"
Harvey,event_george1,"You see, George, I'm just trying to help you.$bThanks, @.$h"
Harvey,event_george2,"Look, George. If you want to behave like this I'm going to have to tell your wife. I don't think she'll be happy.$b*Sigh*$s"
Harvey,event_aerobics1,"Thanks, @. I appreciate that.$h"
Harvey,event_aerobics2,*Sigh*... rude.$s
Harvey,event_heart1,"Just try and relax. I'm here to help.$h$bOh! Hospitals make you nervous, huh?"
Harvey,event_heart2,Okay. That makes sense.
Harvey,event_heart3,Um. Okay... If you say so.$s
Harvey,event_grave1,...Thanks.$b...You're right.
Harvey,event_grave2,*sigh*$s
Harvey,summer_Mon,Okay. Take care! Stay healthy.$eIt's okay to get a moderate amount of sunlight. Just don't get burnt.
Harvey,summer_Thu,"Make sure and listen to your body.$eExercise is important, but don't get too exhausted, or you might end up at my clinic!"
Harvey,summer_Fri,"People don't get sick much during the summer. That's nice, but it also means less business for me."
Harvey,fall_Fri,"It's a dangerous place. I recommend against it.$eHave you been going into the mines, @?"
Harvey,fall_Sat,Eating a 'Farmer's Brunch' will give you the nutrition you need to water and harvest crops better!$eWhen you eat certain foods you'll perform better.
Harvey,winter_Wed,"Make sure to wash your hands often.$eIt's flu season, so you'd better be extra careful."
Harvey,winter_Sun,"Don't get the wrong idea! I want people to be healthy... really!$eI guess if people stopped getting sick, I'd be out of business.$eI hate to say this, but I do make a lot more money during flu season."
Leah,Introduction,"You picked a good time to move here... The spring is lovely.$eHello, it's nice to meet you. $h"
Leah,Resort_Entering,"Don't tell anyone, but Willy let me steer the boat for a few minutes.$h"
Leah,Resort_Leaving,"Well, that was deeply relaxing."
Leah,Resort,"I love the weather in Stardew Valley, but seeing a different climate now and then helps put things into perspective."
Leah,Resort_Shore,I wonder if I could ever capture that sort of formlessness in a sculpture.$eThe shape of the waves here is awe inspiring.
Leah,Resort_Chair,I like the heat as long as I'm keeping perfectly still.$h
Leah,Resort_Wander,"Though Willy probably wouldn't be happy with me if I dragged a bunch of logs onto his ship!$h$eMmm, I bet the trees around here would make for an interesting medium to work with."
Leah,Resort_Wander_2,I think I saw some tasty looking walnuts growing on a bush nearby.$eI wonder what kind of things you could forage out here.
Leah,Resort_Bar,Have you tried the Piña Colada? I'm on my second one... hehe.
Leah,danceRejection,I'll be honest. I don't want to dance with you.$u
Leah,divorced,I've realized I'm happier by myself. So just leave me be.$u
Leah,breakUp,Ohh... Got it. Hah... I really don't have any luck when it comes to this stuff...$s
Leah,dumped_Girls,I don't want to see you for a while...$s
Leah,secondChance_Girls,You caused a lot of grief with what you did... but I'm ready to put the past behind us.$s
Leah,Beach,"I came for the sound of the ocean. Beautiful, isn't it?"
Leah,Mon,"I wanted to escape my old life.$r 22 5 Mon_22To follow in grandpa's footsteps.$r 211132 5 Mon_211132It's more ""real"" than living in the city.$r 22 5 Mon_22I want to make tons of money.$r 21 -5 Mon_21So why did you become a farmer?$q 21/22/211132 Mon_oldThe trees look nice today, don't they?"
Leah,Mon_old,So are you making as much money as you hoped?|Spending time in nature is very rewarding.$p 21
Leah,Mon_21,"Hmm. That seems kind of shallow, doesn't it?$s"
Leah,Mon_22,"That's pretty much the reason I came here, too!$h"
Leah,Mon_211132,That's very sweet to honor your grandfather like that.
Leah,Tue4,"You're probably busy. Sorry.$eFarming seems like a very rewarding profession. You get to create delicious food for everyone!$h$eI don't make art for money. It's just an urge that I have.$eThe landscape around here gives me a lot of ideas. The terrain is almost like a sculpture itself.$eHi. Oh, you want to talk?"
Leah,Tue,"We both live outside of town. Does that mean something?$eHello, neighbor."
Leah,Wed,Sometimes I think it's impossible to live without destroying nature in some way.$eThis morning I accidentally stepped on a bug.$s$1 LeahBug
Leah,Wed6,"Farm animals are wonderful, too.$h$eI love being around animals. They're so innocent."
Leah,Wed8,"Wouldn't it be nice to have help, though?$l$eI was imagining how good it must feel to harvest a big bunch of crops.$h$eHi @! I was just thinking about you and your farm."
Leah,Thu,"I've been having fresh salads almost every day.$h$eThere's actually a lot of wild food in this area, if you know where to look."
Leah,Thu6,Foraging is a specialty of mine. Someday I'll make you a fresh salad.$h
Leah,Fri,It's simpler to be friends with the trees. They don't have much to say.$h
Leah,Fri2,We wouldn't be able to survive without nature. It's good to remember that.
Leah,Fri4,"Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h$eHello, @. It's a nice day, isn't it?"
Leah,Sat,I love to decorate for the different seasons.
Leah,Sat8,"Farming sounds so fun. I want to try it, someday.$l"
Leah,Sun,"If you hear any banging from inside my hut, it's probably just me working on one of my sculptures."
Leah,Sun8,"It would be special that you gave it to me.$l$eIf you ever find any interesting looking driftwood, I could use it."
Leah,event_sculpt1,"Oh! Yeah, that's absolutely right!$h$b...What?$7"
Leah,event_sculpt2,"But as a human, I'm also interested in how we shape and interpret the world around us... I guess what I'm saying is that I'm interested in 'art'.$bThere's nothing wrong with that... I think there's lots of beauty to be found in raw, untouched nature!"
Leah,event_sculpt3,Get out!$a^That's good to know.$l$bYou pig!%fork$a^Oh! You're...? Me too.$6
Leah,event_parents1,It was better for both of us... to end an unsustainable relationship while we were still young and flexible.$u$bYou're right... I just wouldn't have been happy back there.$u
Leah,event_parents2,"That's a little harsh... but, yeah. We had different priorities.$u"
Leah,event_parents3,"Oh yeah? Well maybe I'll just leave, then!%fork$a"
Leah,event_parents4,I guess you're right... it was kind of selfish. But can you really blame me for wanting to be happy? Ugh... I don't know...$s$b*sigh*...$s
Leah,event_parents5,I probably shouldn't dwell on it. We all have to make hard choices from time to time.$s$bMaybe you're right... Humans are selfish creatures. I don't know. $s$b*sigh*...$s
Leah,summer_1,You can tell it's summer by the sweet smell of nectar wafting through the air!$h
Leah,summer_Mon,"Keep looking, I'm sure you'll find something.$eSorry, I don't have any left.$s$eI found some wild fruits this morning!"
Leah,summer_Tue,"The sound of farm animals is great, isn't it?"
Leah,summer_Tue4,"The simple things in life are best: a soft summer breeze, majestic clouds, and a goblet full of Stardew Valley red."
Leah,summer_Thu6,I have a good eye for wild fruit. Some day I'll make you a nice fruit salad.$h
Leah,summer_Fri,"It's a slow process, but the result can be quite valuable.$eYou can use a tapper to harvest syrups and other useful liquids directly from trees."
Leah,summer_Fri2,"Don't you think so?$eI hate to be blunt, but if we don't treat nature with respect, our grandchildren will be doomed."
Leah,summer_Fri6,"Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h$eHello, @. Do you ever get lonely on that big farm?"
Leah,summer_Sat,I can't tolerate heat very well.$eThe flowing water keeps my house a little bit cooler in summer.
Leah,summer_Sun,"Any ideas?$eWhat should I do on such a warm, lazy day? *sigh*"
Leah,fall_1,It's shocking.$eHow quickly the seasons change!
Leah,fall_Mon,Keep your nose to the ground and you'll find some mushrooms yourself... I'm sure of it.$eI had a huge plate of wild mushrooms and eggs for breakfast today... I'm still full.$eI found some wild mushrooms over the weekend!$c .5
Leah,fall_Tue,They're just so colorful... I can't help but think of the potential for art projects.$h$eI wonder if I could make a collage out of dried leaves?
Leah,fall_Tue4,"Although, some people have opinions that I just can't respect.$eEveryone has a unique and interesting perspective, whether they believe it or not. Don't you think so?"
Leah,fall_Wed,I fall asleep to the soothing sound of water every night.$eIt's so nice to live by the river.
Leah,fall_Thu6,One of these days I'll have to make you a wild mushroom stir-fry.$h
Leah,fall_Fri,"If you have a kitchen, you can cook all kinds of delicious meals.$h$eDo you have a kitchen in your house?"
Leah,fall_Fri6,Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h
Leah,fall_Sat,Decorations accentuate the feeling of the season. I think it's a worthwhile tradition.
Leah,fall_Sun,It feels good to stretch your legs.$eThere's a lot of good places to walk around here.
Leah,winter_Mon,I love the way everything looks when it's covered with fresh snow.
Leah,winter_Tue,"I just snuggle up under a huge blanket, and I'm okay.$h$eIt gets pretty cold in my little cabin.$s"
Leah,winter_Wed,"I saw a snow rabbit early this morning! They're rare, aren't they?"
Leah,winter_Thu,I've been eating a lot of bread.$s$eI'm having a hard time finding fresh food to eat.
Leah,winter_Thu6,"I bet your farm is pretty well stocked with food, huh?$e*Sigh*... It's hard to get fresh food in the winter."
Leah,winter_Fri,"When I lived in the city, the year went by so fast.$eTime seems to move slower here."
Leah,winter_Fri6,Stop by my cabin if you want to huddle under one of my quilts and drink cider.$h$eDo you ever get cold in that farmhouse of yours?
Leah,winter_Sat,Hello. Do you want something?
Leah,winter_Sat2,"Hello, @. Is there something you wanted to talk about?"
Leah,winter_Sun,It's a refreshing break.$eDo you ever take a whole day off?
Abigail,Rainy_Day_0,The dark... the rain... it gets me excited.$l
Abigail,Rainy_Day_1,"You really surprised me with that mini-harp... I never expected that. I guess that's why I like you so much.$l$eHey, remember when we played that duet by the lake? This weather reminds me of that day."
Abigail,Rainy_Day_2,Think you can find something better than that? I'm not so sure!$h$eHey! I woke up early and did some exploring on my own. I found this and it reminded me of you. [768 767 769 66 82]
Abigail,Rainy_Day_3,"If you go, bring a Life Elixir or two.$eIt might be a good day to visit the caves, huh? Just be careful out there."
Abigail,Rainy_Day_4,Maybe I'll boot up Journey Of The Prairie King today... one of these days I swear I'll beat it on my own.$h
Abigail,patio_Abigail,%Abigail is lost in her music.
Abigail,Rainy_Day_Abigail,"The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?"
Abigail,Rainy_Night_0,I was just gazing out into the rainswept woods... I swear I saw something darker than black shifting around the trees.$6
Abigail,Rainy_Night_1,It's a good night to see a ghost...
Abigail,Rainy_Night_2,Can you feel it? There's a stillness in the rain...
Abigail,Rainy_Night_3,"On nights like this, I like to turn the light down low and just listen...$8"
Abigail,Rainy_Night_4,I felt like making some soup for dinner. I hope it's not too disgusting. [199 218 219 727 730]$h
Abigail,Rainy_Night_5,Hey! You look like you've been hard at work. Can I help you relax?^Have you been working hard? You look cute when you're a little exhausted.$h
Abigail,Rainy_Night_Abigail,The sound of rain should put us right to sleep tonight.
Abigail,Indoor_Day_0,"I always loved this place, long before you moved in. Now I can explore the farm whenever I want!$h"
Abigail,Indoor_Day_1,"Use that if you get into a tough spot. It should help keep you safe.$eHey, @. Heading out into the wild? I got you something...[286 287 205 732]"
Abigail,Indoor_Day_2,"Heading to the mines? Hey... if you find something tasty, remember to bring me a piece!$h"
Abigail,Indoor_Day_3,Hey! I'm just debating what I should do today. I'm not used to having this much freedom!
Abigail,Indoor_Day_4,"You don't mind if I do some re-decorating now and then, do you? I'm still excited to have a place of my own to work on."
Abigail,Indoor_Day_Abigail,There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it.
Abigail,Indoor_Night_0,"I had a good day, today. There's always something interesting goin on around here, if you look close enough."
Abigail,Indoor_Night_1,Hey! Tell me about your day. Did anything exciting happen?$h
Abigail,Indoor_Night_2,"I used to be a night owl, but I'm starting to enjoy the rhythm of life on the farm. It feels natural."
Abigail,Indoor_Night_3,*yawn*... I'm ready to call it a night pretty soon.$h
Abigail,Indoor_Night_4,The sounds of the night are louder out here. I'll never stop enjoying that.
Abigail,Indoor_Night_Abigail,Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us...$l
Abigail,Outdoor_0,The soft breeze is blowing mountain air throughout the valley today. It smells like fresh pine and sage.
Abigail,Outdoor_1,Hmm... I think we've got plenty of space for outdoor slime ranching!
Abigail,Outdoor_2,"Make sure to keep things tidy around your Grandpa's shrine. There's something special about it, I can feel it."
Abigail,Outdoor_3,It's pretty cool that we have a cave on our property. It's something I always dreamed about.$h
Abigail,Outdoor_4,I always forget to put some snacks in my pocket. *rumble*$h
Abigail,Outdoor_Abigail,"There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. *chuckle*$h$eI'm just going to hang out here, okay?"
Abigail,funLeave_Abigail,"I'm going in to town today, just so you know. I need to stretch these legs a bit."
Abigail,funReturn_Abigail,Hey! Did you have a good day? Mine went well. It was refreshing to take a walk.$h
Abigail,OneKid_3,"I can't believe I'm a ""mom""... life is weird.$h"
Abigail,TwoKids_0,I already gave %kid1 and %kid2 their chocolate cereal. They were screaming!
Abigail,TwoKids_2,I had a dream that %kid2 will grow up to be a famous monster hunter. I've already been thinking about a little armor set.
Abigail,TwoKids_3,"A cool old house, a couple kids, and an amazing farm. I never thought I'd come this far... but, hey! Our lives are just getting started.$h"
Abigail,Good_1,Did you hear that? Sometimes I'm convinced this house is haunted.$u
Abigail,Good_2,Welwick's horoscope predicted great things for me today. I feel really motivated!
Abigail,Good_3,"I can't even remember the last time I dyed my hair... I swear, it never fades from this color..."
Abigail,Good_4,I'm glad I owned a heavy pair of boots before moving in. It's hard to imagine tip-toeing around the mud in sneakers.$h
Abigail,Good_5,I was just admiring the mermaid's pendant you gave me... I'll proudly wear this to my grave.$l
Abigail,Good_6,"Just promise me you'll be careful. I don't want to lose you.$eHey. I know you're smart, but I still worry about you sometimes. The world is full of monsters.$6"
Abigail,Good_7,@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for us. I'm really proud of you.$l
Abigail,Neutral_0,I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and shriveled. It's going to happen some day!
Abigail,Neutral_1,Do you think your Grandpa would be proud of us?
Abigail,Neutral_6,I wonder how the old shop is doing? I should visit my parents again soon.
Abigail,Neutral_7,"If you moved on to the spirit world, I'd set up a little shrine for you next to Grandpa's."
Abigail,Neutral_8,"I guess farms are kind of dirty.$eNo matter how much we clean, the house keeps getting dirty again."
Abigail,Neutral_9,I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? I might get bored.
Abigail,Bad_7,"I used to be special to you, your best friend... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.$s"
Abigail,Bad_8,You've been so cold to me lately... What's wrong with you? You're acting like a bog spirit...$s
Abigail,Bad_9,I wonder if I could've done better... I was very good friends with Sebastian before we met. He was probably the one...$s
Abigail,spring_1,"So, do you have any big plans for the new year?"
Abigail,spring_12,"I plan on winning that egg hunt. Go ahead and try to beat me.$eHey, the egg festival is tomorrow. I'm sorry, but I won't go easy on you because we're married!$h"
Abigail,spring_2,Do you have any new year's resolutions? I'm trying to lose a few pounds around the middle.$h
Abigail,summer_1,"I hope you like me pale!$h$eI get sunburnt very easily, so I need to be careful this time of year."
Abigail,summer_4,"Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself.$eMake sure you don't get a heat stroke, my love."
Abigail,summer_8,Sorry about the smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.
Abigail,summer_15,"Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's fun!$h$eIt's summer... that means the house is full of flies."
Abigail,fall_6,"Ah... fall. This might be my favorite time of year. The colors really complement my hair, don't you think?"
Abigail,fall_1,"The scent is unmistakable... mushroom, rotting leaves, pumpkin. It's fall, alright. Isn't it lovely?"
Abigail,fall_2,"Can we grow giant pumpkins this season? Please, honey?$h"
Abigail,fall_20,"Now, a chest full of amethyst? Hmm... I'd have to think about that one.$h$eHoney... you're worth more to me than a chest full of quartz."
Abigail,winter_3,I actually like the cold weather. It just gives me an excuse to get cozy!$h
Abigail,winter_15,It's fun to explore the valley in winter! Everything is so different under a blanket of snow. And so quiet...
Abigail,spring_Abigail,"I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive."
Abigail,summer_Abigail,Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake.
Abigail,fall_Abigail,Do I smell pumpkin on you? Maybe I'm just dreaming...$h
Abigail,winter_Abigail,"Remember when we played 'Prairie King' together in my room, so long ago? Those were good times.$h"
Abigail,spouseRoom_Abigail,I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell.$eI got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.$c .5
Alex,Rainy_Day_0,"With all this space, I can really achieve a full body workout."
Alex,Rainy_Day_1,I never had many friends in town... I sometimes wonder how I'd end up if you never moved here.$9
Alex,Rainy_Day_2,Aw... I was gonna do some jogging outside. But I can't really do it in this weather.
Alex,Rainy_Day_3,*grumble*... I just woke up and I'm hungry for some protein.$9
Alex,Rainy_Day_4,I think I might start reading books. I don't want to become stagnant now that I'm a married guy!
Alex,patio_Alex,Unghh... one... Unghhh... two... It feels great to lift weights outdoors!$6
Alex,Rainy_Night_0,"Hey, did you have a good day? I'm sure tomorrow will be even better.$h"
Alex,Rainy_Night_1,How's it going? I've been carrying the old gridball around with me all day. A guy can pretend...$u
Alex,Rainy_Night_2,Oh... the smell? I've been eating garlic all day. I'm trying to stay manly... Sorry.$l
Alex,Rainy_Night_3,I've been setting aside a few scraps for Dusty. He deserves a treat now and then.
Alex,Rainy_Night_4,"I was hungry so I made some dinner. Here, I saved you a plate. [241 242 225 214 198]$h"

Alex,Indoor_Day_1,"If you want to get strong, you have to eat like you mean it!$eHey, honey! I made you a hot breakfast.[195 210 211]"
Alex,Indoor_Day_2,Come here. *squeeze*... Mmhmm. You're firming up from all that farm work.
Alex,Indoor_Day_3,"I'm still getting used to cooking and doing laundry... It's not exactly my favorite, but I knew what I was getting into when I married you.$h"
Alex,Indoor_Day_4,"There's a couple things around the house that I'm going to try and fix today. Don't worry about me, I'm not bored."
Alex,Indoor_Night_0,"It feels good to push yourself to the limit, doesn't it? You'll really feel like you earned your place in the soft bed tonight."
Alex,Indoor_Night_1,Did you get a haircut or something? You're looking pretty good today. Maybe it's all that fresh air...$l
Alex,Indoor_Night_2,Tell me all about your day. It's good to get everything off your chest now and then.
Alex,Indoor_Night_3,Hey... I got some new shorts. I thought you might be interested to know...$l
Alex,Indoor_Night_4,"If you need some quiet time to yourself, that's okay with me."
Alex,Outdoor_0,Hey. When I stand here and look out over our land... I'm really proud. You've done great work.
Alex,Outdoor_1,This is a great place to raise children. I would've loved growing up in a place like this. So much room to run around!
Alex,Outdoor_2,I like to spend as much time outside as possible. It just feels better to be out here.
Alex,Outdoor_3,"Look at us, with our little farm. We make a cute couple.$h^Hey. Maybe it's the golden light, but you look beautiful today.$l"
Alex,Outdoor_4,Ahh... It feels great to be outside. Stardew Valley really is the most beautiful place...
Alex,OneKid_0,I'm still getting used to my new life as a stay-at-home dad.$h
Alex,OneKid_1,"Little %kid1 is going to grow up strong, just like Daddy."
Alex,OneKid_3,I wonder what it's like to be pregnant...?$h
Alex,TwoKids_2,Maybe %kid2 will be the first professional gridball player from Pelican Town?$h
Alex,TwoKids_3,I finally have the family life that I missed out on as a kid... thank you.$l
Alex,Good_0,@... I will always love you.$l
Alex,Good_1,You're very handsome... have I told you that?$l^You're very beautiful... have I told you that?$l
Alex,Good_6,"I know you're strong, but sometimes I worry that you might get eaten by slimes... or worse. Just be careful.$9"
Alex,funLeave_Alex,I'm going into town today. I'll see you tonight.
Alex,funReturn_Alex,"I had a good day. I like to see my grandparents often, they're getting pretty old."
Alex,spring_1,"Finally, the snow has melted and the sun is back! My body feels great.$h"
Alex,spring_6,I wonder if a powder of stardrop would help me bulk up...
Alex,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? I guess it'll be good to load up on the free eggs.
Alex,spring_23,"Those jumpsuits are pretty tight... and everyone's going to be watching closely.$eOh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I better do some extra push-ups tonight.$9"
Alex,summer_1,"Summer's a very energetic time of year, and body feels it too! I feel solid."
Alex,summer_10,I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!$h$eHave you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?
Alex,summer_27,Aw... summer's almost gone. My muscles are starting to deflate...$s
Alex,fall_1,"Well, summer's over... but I'm going to stay positive. The warmer seasons will always return."
Alex,fall_15,"I don't care one way or another.$eTomorrow's the fair, are we going to go?"
Alex,fall_26,I hope my grandparents are doing okay. Grandpa's too cheap to turn on the furnace until the last minute.
Alex,winter_1,Make sure you stay warm this winter. I worry about your delicate skin.
Alex,winter_7,Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow? I think you can win it!

Elliott,Indoor_Day_0,I've been taking much better care of myself now that we're together. The bachelor life wasn't particularly healthy for me.

Elliott,Outdoor_2,I might stay here and write some poetry. I'm feeling a sudden surge of creativity! You go on ahead and take care of business.
Elliott,Outdoor_3,"If I stay perfectly still, perhaps a resplendent butterfly will bless my nose with a landing."
Elliott,Outdoor_4,Oh... sorry about the coffee breath.$7$eI drank too much coffee... my mouth feels about as dry as the Calico Desert.$s
Elliott,OneKid_0,Have you had any time to entertain little %kid1 today? Maybe a second child will make things easier for both of us.
Elliott,OneKid_1,Little %kid1 is going to have the perfect childhood here. There's so much to explore.
Elliott,OneKid_3,Caring for babies isn't exactly my strong suit... but I'll do my best to be a good father.

Elliott,Good_5,I'm doing a walking meditation. It's good for creativity.
Elliott,Good_6,Be careful out there! I do worry about you sometimes. There are people in the world who would take advantage of you.

Elliott,fall_15,"I might set my pride aside and sink my eager teeth into a sloppy, saucy barbecue sandwich tomorrow."
Elliott,fall_26,Would you still love me if I guzzled two gallons of pumpkin ale at the Spirit's Eve festival? Sometimes a man has primitive urges...
Elliott,winter_1,Winter is a great time to read books and play the piano. Remember to pause and enjoy a quiet moment or two.
Elliott,winter_7,"I'm a little out of practice, but I plan on entering the fishing contest tomorrow! You've got some stiff competition, dear."
Elliott,winter_28,"Happy new year's eve, my dear. Please accept this to celebrate. [348]"
Emily,Rainy_Day_0,I wonder where the flying insects go when it rains? Don't they get hit by the raindrops?

Emily,Outdoor_4,"It's okay, @... you deserve a good night of rest.$eGood morning! I was wondering when you'd finally roll out of bed!$h"
Emily,OneKid_0,I hope we can raise %kid1 to be kind and considerate. That's more important than getting A's in school.
Emily,OneKid_1,"I guess we'll just see where fate leads us.$eIs one child enough, or should we raise another?"
Emily,OneKid_3,I lit a pale green candle and shook a sprig of baby-mint over %kid1. That should ward off any dangerous spirits.
Emily,TwoKids_1,"A big house, two kids and a parrot... I have my hands full!"
Emily,TwoKids_2,"Well, %kid2 certainly has your hair...$u"
Emily,TwoKids_3,"Oh, I already fed the kids their organic quinoa puffs with goat milk. You just focus on the farm!"

Emily,spring_2,"My friends, the plants, have come back to life. I feel content."
Emily,spring_1,"Happy new year, honey. Let's make this a special one.$4"
Emily,spring_22,Hmm... I'm thinking maybe a salad of fresh foraged greens for dinner tonight?

Emily,summer_2,May Yoba bless you on this lovely day.$7
Emily,fall_1,The year's already half-way over. Can you believe it?
Emily,fall_25,"To our distant ancestors, this feeling was encompassing and vital. For us, it only barely peeks through the noise of modern life.$eOur bodies are naturally in tune with the seasons. This light and color of fall compels us to prepare for the barren winter."
Emily,winter_15,"On a day like this, I have a craving for cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom."

Harvey,Indoor_Night_3,"It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as %farm Farm."
Harvey,Indoor_Night_4,Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem.
Harvey,Outdoor_0,"This is a very safe spot. You go on ahead and take care of business, don't worry about me."

Harvey,TwoKids_0,I already gave %kid1 and %kid2 their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!
Harvey,TwoKids_1,I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once.

Harvey,fall_15,"Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while.$h"
Harvey,fall_26,"I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave."
Harvey,winter_1,"Don't worry, I'll rub a little truffle oil onto your back every night.$l$eThe air is very dry during winter. That's why our skin tends to become irritated."

Leah,Outdoor_4,"Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.$h$eDon't overwork yourself, dear."
Leah,funLeave_Leah,I'm going to take a nature walk today. I need to get out of the house.
Leah,funReturn_Leah,"I had a nice, relaxing time today. How did your day go?"
Leah,OneKid_3,It's fun to be a parent. I want to make sure %kid1 grows up to have a love for the outdoors.
Leah,TwoKids_3,"We've got a wonderful farm and a full family. Our new life has really turned out well, hasn't it?"
Leah,Good_0,"Living here, I feel like I'm on the summit of a great mountain."
Leah,Good_1,Did I ever tell you... when you first moved here I had a dream that we'd be together someday.
Leah,Good_2,"It could've gone entirely differently at any point.$bSometimes it's hard not to believe in destiny... the fact that I decided to move here, and that we found each other."
Leah,Good_3,"Wow, you look full of energy today!$l^You look beautiful today.$l"
Leah,Good_4,Mmm... You smell nice today.
Leah,Good_5,I was just admiring my wedding amulet... I'll cherish this treasure for the rest of my life.$l
Leah,Good_6,Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry about you falling into a mine shaft.
Leah,Good_7,@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household.$h
Leah,Good_8,Don't worry about me... I know you've got a lot of responsibilities outside of the house. I'm fine in here by myself!$l
Leah,Good_9,"It's a simple life, but I like it.$h$eOh, I'm not bored... I'm just enjoying what we have here."
Leah,Neutral_0,I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and gray.
Leah,Neutral_1,I wonder who lived here before us?
Leah,Neutral_2,Don't you have anything to do today?
Leah,Neutral_3,"If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me."
Leah,Neutral_4,I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time.
Leah,Neutral_5,"Are we doing okay on money, @?"
Leah,Neutral_6,I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?
Leah,Neutral_7,I don't really feel like doing anything today.
Leah,Neutral_8,"I guess farms can be kind of dirty.$eNo matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again."
Leah,Neutral_9,I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?
Leah,Bad_0,...Do you still love me?$s
Leah,Bad_1,*sigh*... Maybe we got married too young.$s
Leah,Bad_2,Are you still happy with me?s
Leah,Bad_3,Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately.$s
Leah,Bad_4,Do you ever wonder what else is out there?$s
Leah,Bad_5,I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for?$a$eYou used to be romantic... what happened?$s
Leah,Bad_6,We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it?$s
Leah,Bad_7,I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.$s
Leah,Bad_8,You've been so cold to me lately...$s
Leah,Bad_9,I wonder if I could've done better.$s
Leah,spring_2,"So, what are we planting this season?"
Leah,spring_1,That was some way to ring in the new year last night...$l
Leah,spring_15,*sigh*... I guess it's time for the 'spring cleaning' again.$s
Leah,summer_1,"Ah, summer... I can smell the spice berries already.$h"
Leah,summer_9,Sorry if I'm wet to the touch... I was sweating all night in the heat.
Leah,summer_2,"Don't worry, I'll take care of them.$eIt's summer... that means the house is full of flies."
Leah,fall_1,I love fall for the mushroom hunting opportunities. It comes and goes pretty fast.
Leah,fall_20,Have you planned for winter at all? It's good to have a stockpile of hay.
Leah,fall_2,I know harvest season is a busy time for you. I'll try and help out as much as I can.
Leah,winter_1,"Winter's here, and that means crystal fruit is in season. It has such a unique flavor, don't you think?"
Leah,winter_7,"I'm looking forward to carving ice sculptures tomorrow. I only get to do it once a year, but it's a lot of fun!"
Leah,winter_28,"Next year is going to be great, I can feel it.$eHey, here's to another great year at %farm farm! Let's have some fun tonight! [348]$h"
Maru,Rainy_Day_0,I wonder how Penny is doing? Maybe I'll give her a call later today.
Maru,Rainy_Day_1,I was just daydreaming... do you think MARILDA is okay? I hope she finds some place where she truly belongs...
Maru,Rainy_Day_2,"I hope you can find some use for it.$eHey! I had trouble sleeping last night so I fiddled around in my workshop for a bit. Here, I made this for you. [688 369 338 325 287]"
Maru,Rainy_Day_3,The only thing I dislike about rain is the fact that I can't do any stargazing!
Maru,Rainy_Day_4,Do I hear a leak in the roof? I'll have to check it out. I know a thing or two about carpentry from watching my mother.
Maru,Rainy_Night_0,Make sure you don't leave your tools out in the rain! You wouldn't want them to get all rusty.
Maru,patio_Maru,"I'm not sure what this is, yet... but it's fun to turn the old wrench now and then."
Maru,Rainy_Night_1,This weather gives me gadget ideas... maybe if I funnel the rainwater it could power a mill?$eHi @. How was your day... soggy?
Maru,Rainy_Night_2,"It's a little too early to tell, but the results have revealed some abnormal trends.$eDad's been tracking the weather patterns for the last twenty years."
Maru,Rainy_Night_3,Can we have spaghetti in bed tonight?
Maru,Rainy_Night_4,"I made some dessert! Make sure to brush your teeth before bed, though. [232 234 223 220]$h"
Maru,Rainy_Night_5,"It was relaxing, though. I kicked back with the latest 'Schematics Weekly'.$eMy day wasn't all that exciting... I stayed inside because of the weather."
Maru,Indoor_Day_0,"Hmm? Sorry, sometimes I get so lost in thought that I don't even realize what I'm doing."
Maru,Indoor_Day_1,I found this in my scrap pile. Think you could find a use for it? [286 287 205 732]
Maru,Indoor_Day_2,"Finally, you're up! I was getting so hungry... *rumble*$h"
Maru,Indoor_Day_3,One of the best things about living on the farm is waking up to a chorus of songbirds.
Maru,Indoor_Day_4,How do you keep your hands so soft with all that farmwork?
Maru,Indoor_Night_0,Did you see the moon tonight? It always looks spectacular on the horizon.
Maru,Indoor_Night_1,I saw a shooting star earlier. I like to pretend it's MARILDA stopping by to check on us.$h
Maru,Indoor_Night_2,Be honest... am I gaining weight?$s$eI can't decide if I'm craving chocolate cake or ripe strawberries. Or maybe both...?
Maru,Indoor_Night_3,You did good work today! You deserve to relax the rest of the evening.
Maru,Indoor_Night_4,Mom's done a great job improving the place.$h$eI'm really starting to love this old house. It's so cozy at night.
Maru,Outdoor_0,"Ahh... the farm smells great, it reminds me of the mountains near my parent's house."
Maru,Outdoor_1,"With a little planning, we could automate most of the farm work and just relax!"
Maru,Outdoor_2,It's going to be clear tonight... I wonder if the %noun constellation will be visible?
Maru,Outdoor_3,"Don't worry, I won't mind if you track mud into the house. It's fun to get a little dirty now and then."
Maru,Outdoor_4,I never realized the amount of care and planning necessary to run a farm! It's a lot like working in the laboratory.
Maru,OneKid_0,Have you spent any time with %kid1 today? Kids need playtime in order reach their full potential.
Maru,OneKid_1,What do you think... will %kid1 grow up to be a farmer? Or an engineer?
Maru,OneKid_3,I have high hopes for our child. I've been reading all the scientific data on the best ways to raise children.
Maru,TwoKids_3,"My own workshop, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. Life is pretty good."
Maru,Good_1,"Now that we live together, it's hard to imagine being alone again."
Maru,Good_2,Taking a break? That's good!
Maru,Good_3,There's a lot of strategy to planning and running a farm. It's more intellectually stimulating than I thought!
Maru,Good_4,For a while there I was considering building a robotic husband. But you're a lot more fun!$h^For a while there I was considering building a robotic wife. But you're a lot more fun!$h
Maru,Good_5,I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. This is a very rare specimen!$l
Maru,Good_6,"Last night, I had a dream that I was looking through a gigantic telescope. I saw something moving in the %noun nebula. Kind of spooky."
Maru,Neutral_0,I hope you'd still like me even if I gained weight.
Maru,Neutral_8,I feel uninspired today.$s
Maru,funLeave_Maru,I think I'll visit my parents today. I haven't seen them in a while.
Maru,funReturn_Maru,"Mom and Dad are doing just fine. Their routine is still the same, even with me gone. How was your day?"
Maru,spring_2,"So, what's your strategy for optimizing the farm this year?"
Maru,spring_1,It's wonderful to see all the plants and animals come back to life during the spring.
Maru,spring_22,If my brother wasn't such a hermit I'd invite him over for dinner sometime.
Maru,summer_20,I wonder if my brother will ever have the courage to ask Abigail out?
Maru,summer_2,I like to catalogue the different insects I see in summer.
Maru,fall_1,"With every season, a new section of the night sky becomes prominent. It's fascinating to witness."
Maru,fall_25,"Don't worry, dear. I'll take care of it all.$eWinter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house."
Maru,fall_3,Fall aways reminds me of going out woodcutting with my mom... it might be that smell of freshly cut wood and sap.
Maru,winter_15,The winters have been disturbingly mild lately.
Maru,winter_5,"I hope Dad's doing okay... he can get depressed in winter, when there's less opportunity for field research."
Maru,winter_2,"If you do any mining, promise me you'll be careful.$eYou could do some fishing or foraging...$eSo, what are your plans for maintaining our income this winter?"
Maru,spring_Maru,"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @!$h"
Maru,summer_Maru,"The evenings are so warm, it's really the best time of year for stargazing. Who knows what might up there?"
Maru,fall_Maru,"The farm life is great, but I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community."
Maru,winter_Maru,"I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie in the spring. Oh... that tang, that zest!"
Maru,spouseRoom_Maru,"I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey.$eI got up early to do a little stargazing.$c .5"
Penny,Rainy_Day_0,On rainy days my thoughts always drift toward cinnamon and cookies.
Penny,Rainy_Day_1,"I think Maru will have to make the first move, though.$h$eI wonder if Maru and Dr. Harvey will ever get together? I'm sure Harvey likes her..."
Penny,Rainy_Day_2,"I thought you could really use one of the those.$11$eHi, honey! I did some shopping this morning and got this for you.[186 180 770 535]"
Penny,Rainy_Day_3,"What was it called... 'Chili de @'?$eHmm... maybe I should experiment with a new recipe. You liked the last recipe I made, didn't you, honey?"
Penny,Rainy_Day_4,"On days like this, I love to curl up with a good book."
Penny,Rainy_Night_0,"How was your day, honey? I spent my afternoon reading a novel."
Penny,patio_Penny,This is a lot more peaceful than my old spot in town. I'm very happy here.
Penny,Rainy_Night_1,I'm sure Mom's at the saloon right now... But I don't feel so bad about it anymore. It's out of my hands.
Penny,Rainy_Night_2,I'll never forget that night...$l$eI was just thinking about that night we met in the bathhouse.$l
Penny,Rainy_Night_3,"The sound of rain used to bother me, when I lived in that old metal trailer. But it's quite soothing here."
Penny,Rainy_Night_4,I felt like making a nice dinner. I hope you like it. [212 214 225 209 200]$h
Penny,Indoor_Day_0,"It's so peaceful here. I used to have the most horrific nightmares, but now I sleep like a baby."
Penny,Indoor_Day_1,"It's important to me that you leave here with a full belly.$h$eGood morning, @! I made you a hot breakfast.[195 210 211]"
Penny,Indoor_Day_2,"Gunther asked me to say hi.$eYou know, I think I'll read a book today. I picked up something new from the library last time I was there."
Penny,Indoor_Day_3,"To think... there may have been farmers at this very spot 10,000 years ago.$eI love to hear about all the artifacts you've found. Archaeology is fascinating!"
Penny,Indoor_Day_4,"Was I shy when we first met? It's funny to think about, now that we've come so far.$h"
Penny,Indoor_Night_0,"If not, that's okay. We've got all the time in the world!$eGood evening, honey. Did you accomplish everything you wanted to today?"
Penny,Indoor_Night_1,"Hmm... skirt or pants tomorrow? Oh, who am I kidding... I always go with the skirt."
Penny,Indoor_Night_2,I'm just very grateful for what we have.$eWe have it good here. We should always try and remember those less fortunate than us.
Penny,Indoor_Night_3,You shouldn't feel bad! Mom has to solve her own problems. $eMom's probably pretty lonely now that I'm gone. I just hope she doesn't visit the saloon more to make up for it.
Penny,Indoor_Night_4,Ready to tuck in? I made the bed and everything...$11
Penny,Outdoor_0,"I was so miserable back home.$s$eI only ever dreamed of living in such a beautiful place, and now it's come true."
Penny,Outdoor_1,I would've been so happy growing up on a farm.$eIsn't this a perfect place to raise children?
Penny,Outdoor_2,"I'll be thinking of you.$h$eHi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!"
Penny,Outdoor_3,I just saw a songbird flying due west. In Stardew Valley that's a very good omen.$h
Penny,Outdoor_4,"Ahh... It feels great to be outside. I could spend all day right here, observing every little thing."
Penny,OneKid_0,Have you had any time to play with %kid1 today? Maybe a second child will make things better.
Penny,OneKid_1,Little %kid1 is going to have such a great childhood here.
Penny,OneKid_3,It's not bad! I've wanted this for a long time.$11$eI feel a lot older now that we have a child. Maybe it's just this new responsibility weighing on me.
Penny,TwoKids_0,I already gave %kid1 and %kid2 their food. They're such hungry children!
Penny,TwoKids_1,We have to make sure and give %kid1 a lot of attention now that we have %kid2. We don't want any jealousy between them.
Penny,TwoKids_2,I've had this dream that %kid2 grew wings and flew into the night sky. What does it mean?
Penny,TwoKids_3,"A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. We're so very fortunate."
Penny,Good_0,@...I still can't believe we're married...$l
Penny,Good_1,I had dreams of marrying you for such a long time.$l
Penny,Good_2,I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here...$l
Penny,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?$l^Wow, you look beautiful today. Did you do something different with your hair?$l"
Penny,Good_4,This place is really starting to feel like home.$l
Penny,Good_6,Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry that you aren't eating enough wholesome food.
Penny,funLeave_Penny,"I'm going to head into town today, just for fun. I'll be back in a while!"
Penny,funReturn_Penny,I had a nice time... It's good to stay in contact with everyone. Tell me about your day.
Penny,spring_8,Spring is probably my favorite season. There's a certain freshness in the air that fills me with hope.
Penny,spring_1,"We've got a long, warm year to look forward to. Let's make it a productive one."
Penny,spring_15,"Ah, the 'spring cleaning'... I'm actually going to enjoy this."
Penny,summer_16,*phew*... I need to eat more melon to combat this heat!
Penny,summer_1,"Summer may be searing hot, but the humidity feels great on the skin."
Penny,summer_2,"In summer, the ants become very active. I could watch them for hours... they have a pretty complex civilization from the looks of it!"
Penny,fall_5,"The smell of fall reminds me of the smell of books... weird, isn't it?"
Penny,fall_1,Fall... It makes me think of colored paper and glue. Maybe I'm spending too much time with the children.$h
Penny,fall_2,Will you grow any giant pumpkins this year?$11
Penny,winter_1,Winter's a good time to unwind a bit. You deserve it after the long year!
Penny,winter_6,"The falling snow reminds me of grandma, rocking by the fire. I have this vivid memory of her shadow, flickering against the orange wood... That was long ago."
Penny,winter_3,"How will we stay afloat this winter? Oh, you don't have to tell me... I trust you to make the right decisions."
Sam,Rainy_Day_0,"Hey, you can relax too if you want.$eMight be a good day to sit back and jam on the guitar..."
Sam,Rainy_Day_1,Heh... now that I'm married I'm trying to get everyone else married too.$eDo you think Sebastian and Abigail will ever hook up?
Sam,Rainy_Day_2,"I thought you might be able to use it.$eHey, I found one of these rolling around in the back of a drawer. [90 88 86 535]"
Sam,Rainy_Day_3,"Aw, man. These cloudy days are kind of a drag...$7"
Sam,Rainy_Day_4,How'd you sleep? The sound of rain really makes me zonk.
Sam,patio_Sam,*Sigh*... I'm never gonna land this trick...$s
Sam,Rainy_Night_0,"Hey, how was your day? I just layed around and read comics most of the day... it was great.$h"
Sam,Rainy_Night_1,"It was a pretty low-key day for me... colas, frozen pizza, a few hours noodling around on the guitar. I feel relaxed."
Sam,Rainy_Night_2,"It made me a little nervous that you were there, I didn't want to mess up and have you think I was a loser!$10$bEarlier, I listened to our live recording from that show we played. Remember that? Man, was that sloppy."
Sam,Rainy_Night_3,"But, life's all about change... right? Kids need to learn that, eventually... Or else adulthood will destroy them.$7$eI hope Vincent's not too lonely now that I'm gone... I kinda felt responsible for the little guy.$s"
Sam,Rainy_Night_4,"Hey, I tossed a couple frozen pizzas into the oven. Here's yours. [206]$h"
Sam,Indoor_Day_0,Phew... I'll tell you one thing I don't miss about my old life... working at JojaMart.
Sam,Indoor_Day_1,"What? I never learned to cook... mom always did that.$eHey, I made you some instant pancakes. Enjoy. [211]$h"
Sam,Indoor_Day_2,"Hey. I know I joke around a lot, but I want you to know that I seriously love you...$l"
Sam,Indoor_Day_3,"Oh, not me... I usually decide what to do a few moments beforehand...$eDo you have big plans for the day?"
Sam,Indoor_Day_4,You're not mad?$eUm... Maybe I'll help out on the farm some other day. I feel lazy today.$s
Sam,Indoor_Night_0,"Hey, you look tired. Let me help you relax tonight, okay? Maybe I'll give you a massage later."
Sam,Indoor_Night_1,My day? Oh... I can hardly remember. I didn't really do anything of note. Just relaxed and had a good time.
Sam,Indoor_Night_2,"Hey, sorry I didn't make the bed. You know I'm sloppy... that's why you like me, right?$h"
Sam,Indoor_Night_3,The only thing I miss about living at home is Mom's fish casserole
Sam,Indoor_Night_4,Ready to hit the hay? I actually made the bed for once...
Sam,Outdoor_0,Maybe I should get some off-road wheels for my skateboard. Mayor Lewis can't touch me out here.$h
Sam,Outdoor_1,I always keep an eye on the wide blue sky... you never know when a UFO might go by.
Sam,Outdoor_2,"I'll try and help you with encouraging thoughts.$h$eHi, @! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!"
Sam,Outdoor_3,Something in the air makes me feel positive... maybe it's the faint whiff of pizza from Gus' ovens.
Sam,Outdoor_4,"Wow... you look great today, and the specks of mud just add some extra charm.$l"
Sam,OneKid_0,I'll change %kid1's diaper... don't worry about it. You've got enough on your plate.
Sam,OneKid_1,"It's weird, but I really like being a father!$h"
Sam,OneKid_3,I think we should have another kid. Why stop now?
Sam,TwoKids_0,"I'm just kidding... I didn't marry you for the money.$eI woke up early, fed the kids and changed their diapers! We're all set. You can just focus on raking in that sweet money.$h"
Sam,TwoKids_1,We have to make sure and give %kid1 a lot of attention now that we have %kid2. We don't want any jealousy between them.
Sam,TwoKids_2,It's fun to see the babies playing with each other. I think they're going to be very close.
Sam,TwoKids_3,"I never thought I'd become such a family man, but I'm really satisfied with what we've built here. Life is going great.$h"
Sam,Good_1,"Do you ever think of that night we snuck into my room? I do, often...$l"
Sam,Good_2,"You know, I think I had a feeling we'd be together from the very beginning. There's just something special between us.$l"
Sam,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you do something with your hair?$l^Wow, you look stunning today. Did you do something new with your hair?$l"
Sam,Good_6,Be careful out there! I know you go into the caves sometimes... you could be eaten alive in there!
Sam,Good_4,"I mainly feel like playing guitar when I'm lonely.$eBaby, I was just gonna write you a song on the guitar. But now you're here and I feel relaxed."
Sam,Good_5,"Baby, talk to me! I'm always interested to hear about your day."
Sam,funLeave_Sam,"I'm gonna visit the family today, okay? I'll be home in the evening."
Sam,funReturn_Sam,"Seeing family is nice, but it's also kind of depressing in a weird way. Like... our lives are totally separate now, and everything feels more formal than it used to.$7"
Sam,spring_1,Ub... spring... my doze... allergies.$s
Sam,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be cool to see Sebastian again.
Sam,spring_23,"Whatever. I guess it's funny in a weird way.$eOh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I thought I could get out of it now that we're married."
Sam,summer_1,"The pollen count is a little lower in summer, so my nose is really happy.$h"
Sam,summer_10,"Sorry...$eIt might be funny to put something nasty. You know, to play a prank on the governor!$h$eHave you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?"
Sam,summer_27,"Should we watch the jellyfish tomorrow night? It's always kind of fun.$eSummer's great, but I'm ready for the fall now."
Sam,fall_1,It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.
Sam,fall_15,"Hey, tomorrow's the fair. I need to get my old slingshot wrist back in shape..."
Sam,fall_26,Poor kid. He's gonna have to grow up some day...$eI wonder if Mom will let Vincent enter the haunted maze this year. Probably not...$h
Sam,winter_1,The cold air makes my hair gel freeze. It's not very pleasant.$s
Sam,winter_7,Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? It might be fun to see everyone again...
Sam,winter_28,"We'll just have to make next year even better!$h$eWe had a great year, @... it's kind of sad that it's over."
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_0,Finally... some heavy rain. I get bored of sunny weather easily.
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_1,"I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long.$eHey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell..."
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_2,"I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you.$7$eHey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this... want it?[575 769 767 84 66 78]"
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_3,"Seems like a pretty good day to just lay around, maybe read a book or something... what do you think?"
Sebastian,Rainy_Day_4,"You look cold... here, come closer.$l$eHey, another rainy day... perfect."
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_0,I want to have a future together.$l$eI'm trying my best to quit smoking now that we're married... I don't wanna die on you. It's a bad habit.
Sebastian,patio_Sebastian,Need something? I'll just be over here working on my bike for a while.
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_1,"With your farming income, I can afford to do what I want with my life. It's pretty amazing. Thank you.$h$eI did some work on the laptop today. I was actually brainstorming some ideas for a game I want to make."
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_2,"I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores...$eSorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something."
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_3,"It feels good to take out your aggression now and then, doesn't it?$eHow was your day? Did you slay any monsters?$h"
Sebastian,Rainy_Night_4,Maybe a witch will visit us tonight? Hah.. if only life was that interesting...
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_0,"The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner.$eThe older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy."
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_1,I needed some... woke up early from a nightmare and I just couldn't fall back asleep.$eHey... want some coffee?[395]$7
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_2,"I need to stay independent, even though we're married. That's just how I am. I still love you, though.$7$eI couldn't sleep last night so I went for a night ride on the motorcycle."
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_3,"You seemed scared, but I have to admit... it was kind of cute.$l$eHey. How'd you sleep last night? I heard you mumbling."
Sebastian,Indoor_Day_4,Living here with you is teaching me to come out of my shell a little bit. I think it's good for me.$7
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_0,"The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch.$e...$eHey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting..."
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_1,"I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes.$h$eMaybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired."
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_2,I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone.$eIt's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time.
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_3,"I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there."
Sebastian,Indoor_Night_4,"I often felt unappreciated back home... but here I feel like I really belong. Thanks for making me feel welcome, @.$l"
Sebastian,Outdoor_0,"I feel like I want to do something today... but I'm not sure what. Do you ever have that problem, @?"
Sebastian,Outdoor_1,"I dunno what it is, but I like being indoors. Maybe I'm just so used to my dark basement.$eHmm... sometimes I have to force myself to stay outside for health."
Sebastian,Outdoor_2,I enjoy watching you.$eI'll just watch you from here.$h
Sebastian,Outdoor_3,Just an idea...$h$eI don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out?
Sebastian,Outdoor_4,"Also, different colored slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us.$eWe should raise more slimes... In big quantities they can be pretty profitable. And they're so easy to raise."
Sebastian,OneKid_0,"I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of %kid1! It's just... something new."
Sebastian,OneKid_1,"Maybe when %kid1 is a little older, I'll get a sidecar for the bike and we can all go for a ride.$h"
Sebastian,OneKid_3,Have you smelled %kid1? Maybe it's time for a bath...
Sebastian,TwoKids_0,"Don't worry, I already fed the kids... %kid2 spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again."
Sebastian,TwoKids_1,"If I think back on it, it was mostly my fault...$eI hope %kid1 and %kid2 are nice to each other. Maru and I always fought as kids."
Sebastian,TwoKids_2,"I've had this recurring dream that %kid2 is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?"
Sebastian,TwoKids_3,"Now that I'm here, I like it...$l$eWe've come a long way, @. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation."
Sebastian,Good_0,Now go make us some money.$h$bHey. Look at me. Never forget that I love you... you're everything to me.$l
Sebastian,Good_1,Hey... come here. You look great today.$l
Sebastian,Good_2,"You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day.$l"
Sebastian,Good_3,"I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made.$l"
Sebastian,Good_4,You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.
Sebastian,Good_5,Maybe I'll mellow out with age.$eSometimes I feel so angry... but when you show up I always start to calm down.$7
Sebastian,Good_6,"I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?"
Sebastian,Good_8,I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.
Sebastian,Good_9,I guess I'm not like most people.$eI don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird?
Sebastian,Neutral_0,When I take walks I do my best to avoid everyone. I hate being pressured into small talk.
Sebastian,Neutral_2,Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...
Sebastian,Neutral_3,"Are you going into town today? Why, what are you up to?"
Sebastian,Neutral_4,I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm.
Sebastian,Neutral_5,Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop...
Sebastian,Neutral_6,"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways."
Sebastian,Neutral_8,"House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast."
Sebastian,Bad_5,"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?"
Sebastian,Bad_6,What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away.$a
Sebastian,Bad_7,This place is starting to feel like a tomb.$s
Sebastian,Bad_8,I started smoking again... I've just been really stressed out lately.$s
Sebastian,funLeave_Sebastian,I'm going to take a walk today. I need some time to myself. I'll see you in the evening.
Sebastian,funReturn_Sebastian,"My day was fine, nothing much to tell you about. Why don't you tell me about yours?"
Sebastian,spring_1,Oohh... my head. Happy new year...$h
Sebastian,spring_12,Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be good to see Sam again.
Sebastian,spring_23,"I hate wearing that ridiculous tight jumpsuit. Why does Lewis make us do this?$s$eOh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? Do we have to go?"
Sebastian,summer_1,Summer's here... I need to start slathering the sunscreen pretty thick if I want to maintain my pale complexion...
Sebastian,summer_10,I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!$7$eHave you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?
Sebastian,summer_27,Should we go to the festival tomorrow night? It's actually a tradition I kind of enjoy.$7$eThe weather's starting to cool off. It feels great.
Sebastian,fall_1,It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.
Sebastian,fall_15,"You should play some carnival games, though! Don't worry about me.$7$eThe Stardew Valley Fair is a little crowded for my tastes... but I'll just hang out with Sam. It'll be good to catch up with him."
Sebastian,fall_26,I'm excited for the Spirit's Eve tomorrow. I wonder what horrors we'll find there.$h
Sebastian,winter_1,What are your plans this winter? I know it's more of a laid-back time for you.
Sebastian,winter_7,Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?
Sebastian,winter_28,"I'm sure next year will be even better.$7$eIt's been a great year, @. We should celebrate a little. [346]$h"
Shane,Rainy_Day_0,I'm not too worried... Jas is old enough now to take care of the animals on her own.$eI hope Jas and Marnie are doing alright without me.
Shane,Rainy_Day_1,You know what? I think I've lost some weight since moving in with you.$6
Shane,Rainy_Day_2,I bought some of those a while ago and they're almost expired...$eHere... take this.[346 174 303 305 215]
Shane,Rainy_Day_3,Buhh... I don't feel like being productive today.
Shane,Rainy_Day_4,"@, should I do something useful today?... or just nap forever?"
Shane,Rainy_Night_0,"Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.$h$eHmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls."
Shane,patio_Shane,Charlie's doing well.$8
Shane,Rainy_Night_1,The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.
Shane,Rainy_Night_2,"I guess... if I had some pants I might've gone outside today... but, nah."
Shane,Rainy_Night_3,"I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens."
Shane,Rainy_Night_4,Tip-tappa-tip-tappa-tip... I'm starting to feel thirsty.$6
Shane,Indoor_Day_0,"Buh... sometimes life feels like a slow, gray blur... know what I mean?"
Shane,Indoor_Day_1,Sorry if it's squishy.$eHey. Take this... I put a bit too much in the microwave. [195 215 206]
Shane,Indoor_Day_2,"Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens."
Shane,Indoor_Day_3,"*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.$6"
Shane,Indoor_Day_4,"I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy.$6"
Shane,Indoor_Night_0,I'm just gonna have a couple more beers before closing my eyes for the night.
Shane,Indoor_Night_1,"Now I'm old and weak, though...$bIf... If only... ah, I was just thinking back on the glory days, when I played gridball on the varsity team.$6"
Shane,Indoor_Night_2,Ughh... *gurgle*... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce.
Shane,Indoor_Night_3,You like me for who I am? I still have a hard time understanding that...$eBuh... I wish I was six inches taller and a whole lot smarter...
Shane,Indoor_Night_4,I spent all day watching TV and now my legs feel like soft dough. Guess I'll have to take it easy until tomorrow.
Shane,Outdoor_0,"What juices, you ask? Heh... you're weird.$h$eI didn't sleep well last night so I'm hoping this fresh air will get the juices flowing."
Shane,Outdoor_1,"But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway?$h$eSometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh."
Shane,Outdoor_2,When I stop and think about it... I'm in a good place. My life is pretty nice.$6
Shane,Outdoor_3,Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers.$s
Shane,Outdoor_4,"Hey, @. You were sleeping like a baby so I slipped out of bed and went for a morning walk around the farm. Everything looks fine."
Shane,OneKid_0,"It's weird, when I was younger I swore I'd never have a kid. I wonder what happened to me?$6"
Shane,OneKid_1,Let's make sure to give %kid1 lots of eggs... Baby's gotta grow those legs!
Shane,OneKid_3,Buh... I've become corny in my old age.$ePapa Shane reporting for duty...$6
Shane,TwoKids_0,I already fed the kids two bowls of pizza puffs cereal. They'll be full for a while.
Shane,TwoKids_1,I'll be honest... two kids is enough for me.
Shane,TwoKids_2,Ugh... %kid2 is being a little brat today. Must've gotten that from me...
Shane,TwoKids_3,I'm just kidding.$h$e*Sigh*... If only we could send the kids off to Joja work-camp for a season...
Shane,Good_0,*Sniff*... *sniff*... mmm... what's that wonderful fragrance you're wearing? Eau de pepperoni?$6
Shane,Good_1,"You're a lot better-looking than me, you know that?$h"
Shane,Good_2,The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke.
Shane,Good_3,I'm in a great mood today... The Tunnelers won big last night.$h
Shane,Good_4,"Hey, if I ever seem cranky, just ignore it. I get in weird moods sometimes, but it's not about you... okay?"
Shane,Good_5,"You think it was depressing out front? Kid, you should've seen the back room...$eAh... life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting.$h"
Shane,Good_6,"Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need.$h"
Shane,Good_8,I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.
Shane,Good_9,"Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You really have a short memory span, don't you? *blush*$h"
Shane,Neutral_0,"Oh, do you need something from me? Sorry, I'm kind of busy at the moment."
Shane,Neutral_2,Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...
Shane,Neutral_3,"Working at Joja was a drag, but at least I got to interact with people occasionally."
Shane,Neutral_4,"What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually..."
Shane,Neutral_5,Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to work at Joja.
Shane,Neutral_6,"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys."
Shane,Neutral_8,"Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright."
Shane,Bad_5,"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?"
Shane,Bad_6,What do you want? You sound like Marnie on one of her bad days. Go away.$a
Shane,Bad_7,Farm-life is actually really boring. What am I doing here?$s
Shane,Bad_8,"Yeah... *hic* ... Sure, honey. Whatever you say... *hic*"
Shane,funLeave_Shane,"I'm going to go out today, alright?"
Shane,funReturn_Shane,"Sorry if I'm sweaty... That was quite a walk... Buh, I'm out of shape.$6"
Shane,spring_1,Ooo... my throbbing head. How many did I have last night?
Shane,spring_12,"The egg festival is probably my favorite... you know how I am, I go crazy for anything to do with chickens.$h"
Shane,spring_23,"Oh, right. It's the flower dance tomorrow. Hey, if it makes you happy, I'm happy."
Shane,summer_1,I like seeing all the tropical plants this time of year. The valley gets so lush.
Shane,summer_10,I might fast until the luau tomorrow. I need the ol' bag to be empty so I can fill it with piping hot soup.$h
Shane,summer_27,What are your plans for the fall? I'm going to try and incorporate more wine into my diet.
Shane,fall_1,Hmm... I might have to buy a few cases of pumpkin ale to celebrate the season...$6
Shane,fall_15,"I'll be helping Marnie with the animals at tomorrow's fair, like usual. You should just kick back and have some fun.$6"
Shane,fall_17,I'm starting to really feel my age... and I'm not comfortable with that at all.
Shane,winter_1,Any big plans this winter? I'll probably end up watching a lot of TV and just hanging out around the house.
Shane,winter_28,"Well, another year gone by... I look a little older, but that's about all.$6"
Maru,Introduction,"You know, with a small town like this, a new face can really alter the community dynamic. It's exciting!$eI'm Maru. I've been looking forward to meeting you!$h$bOh! Aren't you the one who just moved in?"
Maru,Resort_Entering,Willy mentioned that you helped fix the boat. Thanks for doing that!
Maru,Resort_Leaving,That was fun!
Maru,Resort,"I've been noticing a few different starfish species. My favorite are the big purple ones, but they're all very interesting!"
Maru,Resort_Towel,Oh... nevermind. It's just your body blocking the sun.$b*gasp*... It's a solar eclipse!$3
Maru,Resort_Towel_2,"Who knows, maybe we'd even see a flying saucer or two!$h$eImagine the stars you could see at night.$bWe're so far removed from civilization out here."
Maru,Resort_Bar,Mmmm... Why are tropical fruits so good?
Maru,Resort_Shore,"Maybe I'd even see you running around %farm Farm!The sky is so clear here, I bet I could spot Pelican Town out in the horizon.I wonder if Willy would let me bring my telescope here sometime..."
Maru,danceRejection,I'm flattered! But... No.
Maru,divorced,We have nothing to say to each other.$a
Maru,breakUp,"Fine...$s$bNot good enough for you, huh?$a"
Maru,dumped_Girls,"You've got some nerve, speaking to me!$a"

Maru,Mon,"It's surprising how much a change of scenery can help.$eWhenever I'm struggling with a technical problem, I always take a walk."
Maru,Tue,Have you met my mother? She's the town's carpenter.
Maru,Wed,"Being a farmer must be pretty easy, huh?$eHe says he likes having me around in case his medical equipment goes haywire!$h$bOn Tuesdays and Thursdays I work at Harvey's clinic."
Maru,Thu,I plan on spending a lot of time with my telescope this summer.
Maru,Sat,"Do you know my Dad, Demetrius? He's a scientist. I have a lot of fun helping him out in the laboratory."
Maru,Fri,"I had to sort patient records for four hours straight! $e I had to carry ten boxes of medical files to the attic!$c .5Hey, sorry if I seem cranky... I'm a little sore from work yesterday."

Maru,Sun_01_02,Yikes! I'm sorry. Have you ever thought of doing something different...?$s
Maru,Tue2,It's always nice to have visitors.$eStop by our house when you need to upgrade your buildings.
Maru,Fri4,My mother is a carpenter and my dad is a scientist. I guess it makes sense that I'm into building gadgets.
Maru,Mon6,Getting some fresh air usually helps.$eSometimes my head gets so cluttered with nonsense I can hardly think. Does that ever happen to you?
Maru,Wed8,"He's nice, but not really my type...$eI work at Harvey's clinic on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
Maru,Thu10,"Oh, @! Is there anything you want to talk to me about?$l"
Maru,Event_Hospital_1,Of course he'll know the difference! This sample is completely ruined!%fork$s
Maru,Event_Hospital_2,"Okay. I'll blame it on you, then.$u"

Maru,event_robot4,@...$8$b...$8
Maru,event_robot_explain1,"Furthermore, isn't it a little arrogant to assume that human-like consciousness is the only worthwhile vessel of existence?

Maru,summer_Tue,"We look totally different.$eSebastian is my half-brother, if you didn't know already."

Maru,Thu_01_01,You don't think I could do it?$s
Maru,Thu_01_02,"You're right, but I love a challenge!$h"
Maru,summer_Sat,"Guess not.$eHey, have any interesting farm stories to tell me?"
Maru,summer_Fri,I guess people get sick less during summer.$eI worked at the clinic yesterday. We didn't have a single patient.
Maru,summer_Sun,Dad says a lot of exotic plants grow in the valley this time of year.$bI bet you're growing some interesting crops right now.
Maru,summer_Fri2,"That's really interesting!$eHey, tell me a story about farming."

Maru,fall_Sun,"Hey, here's to another good week! *toast*"
Maru,fall_Tue2,"I know you like them too.$e@, I just love how the trees look right now!"
Maru,fall_Wed4,"But only if you don't need it yourself.$eIf you have any extra metal laying around, I could always use it for one of my projects."

Penny,event_old1,I guess you're right... why stress out about something you can't change?$u
Penny,event_old2,"I guess the sooner we come to terms with our mortality, the more time we can spend really living in the here-and-now.$u$bYou're right, we shouldn't ignore the reality of aging.$u"
Penny,event_old3,We should treat our elders with the same respect we hope to receive ourselves some day.$bThat's nice of you to say... I totally agree with you.
Penny,event_old4,That's a horrible thing to say. Life is a precious thing to waste like that!$a
Penny,event_cook1,"I've been working so hard on this recipe, and I'm really proud of it.$bYou really mean it? Thank you! ... it's such a relief to hear that.$h"
Penny,event_cook2,"Oh... Uh, sure.$s"
Penny,event_cook3,Oh...I'm sorry.$s
Penny,event_pool1,That's right...$8

Penny,event_family2,...sorry.$s
Penny,event_family3,I see.$s
Penny,summer_Mon,"Hi... Um, nice weather, isn't it?"
Penny,summer_Mon4,"Thanks for fixing the community center back up. I guess you're kind of a town hero.|Hello, @. It's nice to see you're doing well.$d cc"
Penny,summer_Fri,"I heard you were responsible for fixing the bus back up. Thank you.|My mother used to drive the bus to Calico Desert... but the bus stopped working a few years ago. Mayor says there's not enough money in the town coffers, or else he'd have it fixed.$u$d bus"
Penny,summer_Sun,It must be nice having your own place to decorate.$eSo... do you like to decorate your farm house?
Penny,summer_Sat,"The mountains look nice today, don't they?$u$bHello. Ummm...$u"
Penny,fall_Mon,"Hi... Um, are you doing okay?$u"
Penny,fall_Mon4,"I wish I could live in a nice house, someday.$s$eIt's kind of embarrassing to be the only family in town who lives in a trailer.$u"
Penny,fall_Tue4,Your farm looks really pretty right now.$h
Penny,fall_Thu6,I worry about her.$u$eMom doesn't take very good care of herself...$u
Penny,fall_Fri,Fall is a sad time of year for me...$s
Penny,fall_Fri6,"Anyway... How's the farming life going?$eI'm sorry to make things uncomfortable for you... It's just that this time of year makes me think of it for some reason.$u$bWhen I was a little girl, my father abandoned us because he said he felt 'trapped'. We haven't seen him since.$s"
Penny,fall_Sun10,I have a few ideas for myself...$u$eWhere do you picture yourself in ten years?$l$e@! I was just thinking about the future...
Penny,fall_Sat8,"Your farmhouse must be pretty easy to clean, huh?$eHi @.$h"
Penny,winter_Fri,...yes?$u
Penny,winter_Fri2,"It must be so cold to live in a tent this time of year.$eEveryone ignores him, the poor guy. He's actually really nice... Just a little odd.$eAre you friends with Linus? He lives in a tent up in the mountains."
Penny,winter_Tue4,It's going to be so fresh and beautiful.$h$eI'm looking forward to seeing what your farm looks like in the spring.
Penny,winter_Tue,I try to stay indoors as much as possible during the winter. I hate being cold.
Penny,winter_Thu,"He told me he has special gifts for people who donate.$eIf you find any interesting artifacts or minerals, Gunther will gladly display them in the museum.$eOh... hi. You want to talk?$u"
Penny,winter_Mon,It's supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in your life... but for most people it's just a time to relax and exchange gifts.$eOn the 25th we'll be having the Feast of the Winter Star. It's one of my favorite events.
Sam,10,"Or wait, do you even have a TV set...?$bDid you watch the game last night?"
Sam,14,"Ugh, I stepped in something gross earlier... and I just bought these shoes.$s"
Sam,Introduction,"Hey, I'm Sam. Good to meet you.$h"
Sam,Resort_Entering,"Wow, what a spot!"
Sam,Resort,"Willy said we have to stay here, though... some kind of liability issues or something.$s$eI bet there's some cool stuff deeper on the island."
Sam,Resort_Leaving,I'm feeling pretty good from all the sunlight.$h
Sam,Resort_Shore,Check out these gnarly waves... Guess what? I'm gonna save up for a surfboard.
Sam,Resort_Towel,%Sam is playing a jazzy tune on his guitar.
Sam,Resort_Towel_2,"What's the matter, you look worried.$h$eAbby on the congas and Sebastian on the steel drums... 'The Pelicans of Paradise'...$s$eMaybe I should learn to play the ukelele."
Sam,Resort_Bar,"I'm just getting juiced up, then it's back to the beach."
Sam,danceRejection,Hmm... I dunno. Maybe next year.$s
Sam,dumped_Guys,...$a
Sam,secondChance_Guys,"Alright, I'm done with the cold shoulder act. Let's just forget about what happened.$7"
Sam,breakUp,"Yeah, sure... we can still be friends.$9$bI thought we were doing okay... I guess I was way off... alright, then.$9$bWait... what?!$8"
Sam,divorced,"I'm sorry, @. I don't think I can still be your friend.$s"
Sam,Mon2,"Bye, I've got something to do...$eLast night I practiced guitar for 4 hours straight. My fingers hurt like crazy.$s$eHey, how's it going?"
Sam,Mon,"Hey, farmer."
Sam,Mon8,Most people don't know that so keep it on mute.$eI'll tell you a secret... my name 'Sam' is short for 'Samson'.$10
Sam,Tue,"Take it easy.$eOh, hi! It's good to see you again."
Sam,Tue4,"Sleeping feels nice but sometimes I wish I could skip it... it's just such a time-waster.$eHi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?"
Sam,Wed,"Choose anything. It'll still be a horrible song.$r 19 -50 Wed_19Trains.$r 8821 30 Wed_20A city in the sea.$r 8820 30 Wed_20Farming, mining, and chopping wood.$r 20 30 Wed_20Hey..

Sam,Wed_old,But I already know what you think about it.$a|Thanks to your help I'm already done with the lyrics!$h$p 19
Sam,Wed_19,"Hey, man... what the heck is your problem? Sorry I asked.$a"
Sam,Wed_20,"Hey, you know what? That sounds perfect. Thanks!$h"
Sam,Wed6,If you two weren't around I wouldn't really have any friends in town.$eI've been friends with Sebastian for a while. He's a pretty cool guy.
Sam,Wed10,Hey buddy. You look like you're full of energy today!^@. Um... I just wanted to say... You look nice today.$10
Sam,Thu6_1,"You wouldn't abandon the farm after putting so much effort into it!$eI guess you might be able to meet him, then. If you're still living here.$eI think my Dad might be coming back in a year or so."
Sam,Thu6_2,But I guess I haven't seen him in 3 years... so that could explain it.$b...I have mixed feelings about my father being back. He seems strange.$s
Sam,Thu_3,*sigh*... what am I still doing here?
Sam,Thu,"Like scoops of vanilla ice cream floating on blue raspberry sauce... Or maybe I'm just hungry.$eThe clouds look great this time of year, don't they?"
Sam,Thu2,"...I've heard some terrible things about the Gotoro Empire...$s$eHe'll come back someday.$eMy Dad is a soldier, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here..."
Sam,Thu_2,"I'm just glad he's okay.$bWell, my Dad is back. Have you met him?"
Sam,Thu2_2,"I'm just glad he's okay.$bWell, my Dad is back. Have you met him?"
Sam,Fri,"There's a lot more stuff going on, but it's also kinda noisy and hectic... It's hard to say which is better.$eDid I ever tell you we used to live in the city?"
Sam,Fri4,You don't even want to know some of the things he found in people's trash.$eDad used to work as a garbage man in the city.
Sam,Fri10,"So, how are you doing today?$h$eAlthough I could be biased... for a certain reason.$10$bThe older I get the more attached I feel to the valley."
Sam,Sat4,"I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things.$h$eOh! I just remembered I'm supposed to call my Grandma. Okay, I'm going to put this rubber band on my wrist so I don't forget."
Sam,Sat,This happens to me all the time.$eHmm. I just remembered that I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.
Sam,Sun8,I asked her once and got the feeling she was hiding some inner pain.$eSometimes I wonder if my mother is actually happy with her life...$s
Sam,Sun,"Oh, it's a nice day... isn't it?"
Sam,spring_21,"I like summer best, myself.$eSometimes those spring petals that float around make my nose drip.$s"
Sam,Event_band1,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."

Sam,Event_band4,"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band."
Sam,event_room1,"Oh, I see."
Sam,spring_12,My little brother gets so excited for festivals. He's been talking about tomorrow's egg hunt all day.
Sam,spring_23,Why couldn't the flower dance be today so I could get work off?$s
Sam,winter_7,"We were all worried we'd never taste his famous spaghetti ever again.$eOne time, Gus fell in the river during the Ice Festival. We had to build a huge fire in the saloon to dry him out."
Sam,fall_26,"Tonight, after everyone is asleep, that weird old man who lives in the woods will set up the haunted maze. He always makes sure no one is around to see him working."
Sam,summer_10,I don't have to work tomorrow! I've never been so happy.$h
Sam,winter_24,Me? I'm mostly interested in the food. Hehe.$h$bThe Feast of the Winter Star is supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in life.
Sam,event_room2,Yeah... That's what happened!
Sam,event_snack1,He's right... That's what happened.$s^She's right... that's what happened.$s
Sam,event_snack2,Yeah... That's what happened!
Sam,event_snack3,What!? He's lying!$a^What!? She's lying!$a
Sam,summer_Mon2,"See you later.$eI'm hungry.$eHey, how's it going?"
Sam,summer_Mon6,You can find some interesting things there. Dad took me a couple times when I was younger.$eHave you been to the desert yet?
Sam,summer_Mon,There's a little less pollen in the summer... my nose is really happy.
Sam,summer_Tue,"Goodbye for now.$eOh, hi! It's good to see you again."
Sam,summer_Tue4,"I'm so energized during summer I hardly have to sleep!$eHi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?"
Sam,summer_Wed,Sounds interesting.$eHi. Taking the day off?
Sam,summer_Wed2,I hope he didn't crawl into my mouth while I was asleep...$s$eI saw a spider on my ceiling last night. They sure like the warmth.
Sam,summer_Thu,"Dad was telling me about our national enemy, the Gotoro Empire... They sound like a ruthless bunch."
Sam,summer_Thu6_1,...But he won't tell us what's troubling him.$bSometimes I can hear my Dad pacing down the hallway at night.$s
Sam,summer_Fri,"The city is so hot with all that concrete.$eYou know... I used to live in the city and I have to admit, this place is much nicer in the summer.$h"
Sam,summer_Sun,"When you see hot air balloons drifting over the sea, you'll know that summer's in full swing."
Sam,fall_Mon2,...$h$eI like taking walks in the forest this time of year. The temperature is so comfortable
Sam,fall_Mon,"Bye.$eOh, hi. Are you making friends with anyone in town?"
Sam,fall_Tue,"That's what happens when you skateboard too much.$eMy shoes always seem to wear out this time of year. Look, my toe's poking through!$h"
Sam,fall_9,I ordered a new pair of shoes online. They're the same style so I know they'll fit right.
Sam,fall_16,"I guess we must really live in the middle of nowhere.$s$eI ordered some shoes online more than a week ago! Man, they're really taking a long time."
Sam,fall_23,"Ah, my feet feel great in these new shoes. They're a little crisp, but they'll break in. Especially after I run through the haunted maze this weekend.$h"
Sam,fall_Tue4,"Just stop by whenever you want.$eHi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?"
Sam,fall_Wed,"Do you smell that? Maybe Mom's cooking something.$eHey... something smells good, like pizza."
Sam,fall_Thu6_1,I guess that's kind of soon. Weird.$eI think my Dad might be coming back next year.
Sam,fall_Thu6,"I hate making decisions.$e...But I would miss Mom's fish casserole, so I dunno...$s$eI guess I should start thinking about moving out soon...$s"
Sam,fall_Thu,If you get up early you'll see them covered in dew... like little stars.$eDid you ever notice all the spider webs that appear during the fall?
Sam,fall_Fri,"I guess which setting you like depends on your personality.$eThere's way more people around you, always. And it's always bright with city lights, even at night.$eI used to live in Zuzu City, you know. The biggest difference is the noise. It's never quiet in the city."
Sam,fall_Fri10,"So, how are you doing today?$h$eAlthough I could be biased... for a certain reason.$10$bI think I've grown to like the country more than the city.$h"
Sam,fall_Sat4,I guess there's advantages to being the oldest child.$eI'm lucky to have the biggest room in the house to myself.
Sam,fall_Sat,This happens to me all the time.$eHmm. I think I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.
Sam,fall_Sun8,"So do you have anything new to tell me?$eWhatever. I'm just happy that you came to visit me!$eThe first week of fall is already over. Man, that went by fast.$s"
Sam,fall_Sun,It's hard to have fun on Sunday... I keep thinking about having to go to work tomorrow.$s
Sam,fall_14,Hmm.. I wonder if I could grow a cactus in my room?$eHi @.
Sam,winter_Mon2,"Everyone's indoors during the winter, so I can play guitar as loud as I want.$h"
Sam,winter_Mon,"Hi... Cold, isn't it?"
Sam,winter_Tue,"Take it easy.$eOh, hi! It's good to see you again."
Sam,winter_Tue4,"Well, it's a good time of year to catch up on all the sleep I've missed.$h$eHi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?"
Sam,winter_Wed,"I hate working at JojaMart, but how else am I going to make money in this town?|I'm glad I work at the museum now. It's way more interesting than that depressing JojaMart ever was.$d Joja"
Sam,winter_Thu6_1,It's been 3 years since I've seen him. This is going to be strange.$eI think my Dad is coming back this spring.
Sam,winter_Thu6,Dad's been back for a while now. I guess I'm finally getting used to it.
Sam,winter_Thu,"He's coming back soon, though.$eMy Dad is in the military, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here."
Sam,winter_Thu_2,One thing that's nice about winter... all the mosquitos are gone.
Sam,winter_Fri,The worst thing about the snow is getting your feet soaked. You're lucky in those thick boots.
Sam,winter_Sat4,"I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things.$h$eOkay, I'm going to write a note on my wrist so I remember to do it tonight.$bI just remembered I need to change the strings on my guitar."
Sam,winter_Sun8,"So, how have you been doing lately?$ePlus, I don't have a sled.$eI don't think there are any good hills nearby.$s$eIt would be fun if we could go sledding, wouldn't it?"
Sam,winter_Sun,Try not to make a mess in the house or my Mom will flip.
Sebastian,Introduction,"Out of all the places you could live, you chose Pelican Town?$eOh. You just moved in, right? Cool."
Sebastian,Resort_Entering,I liked the boat ride. At one point you couldn't see any land at all..
Sebastian,Resort_Leaving,I'm ready to get back home.
Sebastian,Resort,"The beach is nice, but I don't love the crowds."
Sebastian,Resort_Shore,...Nah.$h$bYou think Willy would let me lug a jet ski out here?
Sebastian,Resort_Wander,"...Now, if I were a tropical frog, where would I hide...$h"
Sebastian,Resort_Wander_2,I bet this place looks pretty cool in the rain.
Sebastian,Resort_Towel,It's good to get away from the computer and see the real world sometimes. I forget how nice it can be.$h
Sebastian,Resort_Bar,"I usually wear black, but in this heat..."
Sebastian,danceRejection,No... There's someone else I want to dance with.
Sebastian,divorced,Why do you keep bothering me? I'm trying to forget about you.$s
Sebastian,dumped_Guys,I don't want to see you for a while.$u
Sebastian,breakUp,"I guess I'll see you around, then...$s$b... alright...$s"
Sebastian,secondChance_Guys,Hey...
Sebastian,Mon,Um... need something?
Sebastian,Mon4,If I just disappeared would it really matter?$s
Sebastian,Tue,Eventually we're going to sink.$bI was thinking... people are like stones skipping over the water.
Sebastian,Tue6,Do you want to hang out for a while?$eI like your new boots!$h^Your hair looks nice today.$h
Sebastian,Wed,Probably nothing.$eWhat am I going to do today?
Sebastian,Wed2,"Umm.. nevermind.$eWell, Abby is nice too, but...$h$eSam is probably my only friend in this town."
Sebastian,Wed2_inlaw_Abigail,"Sam is probably my only friend in this town, anymore..."
Sebastian,Wed6,You and Sam are probably my only friends in this town.$s
Sebastian,Wed10,"Just wondering!$l$eUm... You're single, right?"
Sebastian,Thu,"...want something?$eHi.$eI snuck into the caves last night and got a nasty cut from a rock crab. Don't tell anyone, okay?$1 Sebastian1"
Sebastian,Mountain_47_23,I come here for the peace and quiet.
Sebastian,Thu4,"Sorry...$s$eWhy does everyone like Maru so much? Sure, she's smart and friendly, but don't they realize it's all just an attention-grabbing scam?"
Sebastian,Thu6,Could you picture someone like me living on a farm? It seems ridiculous.$h
Sebastian,Thu8,"It seems ridiculous, but I have been thinking about it lately.$eCould you picture me living on a farm?"
Sebastian,Fri,Uh... I don't really know you.
Sebastian,Fri2,Sports$r 15 -30 Fri_badShopping$r 15 -30 Fri_badComic books$r 16 30 Fri_goodMore Farming$r 15 0 Fri_badSo what do you do when you aren't working?$q 15/16 Fri_old$e*sigh*... If gas wasn't so expensive I'd ride my motorcycle to the city today.
Sebastian,Fri_old,"Hey, if you're bored feel free to hang out in my room...$h|You probably prefer the small-town life, huh?$p 16"
Sebastian,Fri_good,"Oh yeah? Well, did you read the new 'Cave Saga X'? I won't spoil it for you, but oh man...$h"
Sebastian,Fri_bad,"Oh yea? Hmm... Not really my thing, but everyone's different I guess.$u"
Sebastian,Sat,What do you want?$eWhat? I didn't hear you... I'm busy thinking about something.
Sebastian,Sat2,"Maybe I should drink more coffee?$bYou know, I should be doing something productive right now. I just lose focus too fast...$s"
Sebastian,Sun,"Hey. Your name is @, right?"
Sebastian,Sun2,Having a good weekend? ...nice.
Sebastian,Sun4,"For some reason, staring off into the bleak horizon makes me feel... I dunno. Like it's worthwhile to keep pushing on, I guess.$ePretty much only when it's raining, though.$bI usually stay inside, but I do go to the beach now and then."
Sebastian,Fri8,I'll be at the saloon tonight destroying Sam at pool again.$h$eWhat's new?$h
Sebastian,Sun10,I was just thinking about you...$l
Sebastian,Event_game1,"Okay, that'll work."
Sebastian,Event_game2,Good choice. That works well with my role.
Sebastian,Event_cave1,Not so fast! I want to know what it is.
Sebastian,Event_cave2,Really? It was making a lot of noise!
Sebastian,Event_cave3,It's too dangerous without a sword. But I like your sense of adventure.$h
Sebastian,event_garage1,Great.$8
Sebastian,event_garage2,Okay... Nevermind then.$9
Sebastian,event_garage3,"Don't worry, I'll make sure to show you the ropes before I let you do anything dangerous.$8^There's no need to worry... I'll make sure you're safe.$8"
Sebastian,event_city1,"Hmm... Not exactly how I'd put it but, yeah."
Sebastian,event_city2,"Yea... That's exactly how I feel, too.$l"
Sebastian,event_city3,"Oh... Well maybe this wasn't the right place to bring you, then. I thought you'd see the beauty in it.$s"
Sebastian,event_city4,"You're right, though. I'm addicted to these things, it's not good.$s$b...*sigh*$s$bUgh... You sound like my Mom.$a"
Sebastian,summer_Mon,Everyone is so happy in the sun. I don't get it.
Sebastian,summer_Mon6,"Different people like different things, I guess.$eEveryone is so happy when it's sunny out..."
Sebastian,summer_Tue,"I'm looking forward to the cold, damp season. I feel more at home."
Sebastian,summer_Wed,What's the point of going outside? I've already seen it all.
Sebastian,summer_Wed8,Why am I grinning? I guess I've been unusually happy lately...$l
Sebastian,summer_Thu,"Oh, you just stopped to say hi? Sorry.$eI definitely don't want to go swimming, if that's what you're going to ask.$s"
Sebastian,summer_Thu10,If you ever wanted to go swimming... I guess I'd do it.$l
Sebastian,summer_Mountain_58_35,It always seems to stay a little cooler by the lake.$eThe temperature only starts to get comfortable at night.$c .5
Sebastian,summer_Fri,"Oh, hey. *yawn*"
Sebastian,summer_Fri6,"How have you been coping with this heat?$eHey, I'm glad you stopped by.$h"
Sebastian,summer_Sat,I hope we're not having mushroom casserole tonight...$s
Sebastian,spring_12,"I'm not too big on festivals. Lots of commotion, too much social interaction... More stress than fun, if you ask me."
Sebastian,spring_23,Ugh... Tomorrow is the worst festival of the year by a mile. Just wait and see how stupid I look during the flower dance.
Sebastian,fall_20,Are you looking forward to the Spirit's Eve festival? It's probably my favorite.$h
Sebastian,fall_26,I almost feel like they're my friends at this point.$eThe Spirit's Eve festival is tomorrow. I really hope they have those skeletons on display again this year.$h
Sebastian,summer_10,Why ruin the potluck? Hmm... I guess some people feel liberated when the rigid structures of society break down a little. Maybe I'm weird.$eHehe... It might be funny to put something disgusting in the potluck soup tomorrow. Just don't poison anyone.
Sebastian,summer_27,Tomorrow we'll all be gathering at the docks to see the migration of the moonlight jellies. I think it starts at ten o'clock.
Sebastian,winter_24,It's the eve of the winter star today. Better make sure you've got an empty stomach for the feast tomorrow.
Sebastian,summer_Sun,I usually only go outside after dark. Does that sound weird to you?
Sebastian,summer_Sun4,"I guess maybe they are feeding on the mosquitoes this time of year?$eLast night, I saw a group of bats flying around near the lake."
Sebastian,fall_Mon,"So... it's the big harvest season, isn't it?"
Sebastian,fall_Mon4,"I guess I should get a job soon...$s$eYou're probably making a lot of money on your farm, huh?"
Sebastian,fall_Tue,"Pumpkin spice this... pumpkin spice that... man, I do get sick of these seasonal fads."
Sebastian,fall_Tue6,"Who does Demetrius think he is, telling me what to do? He's not even my real father.$a"
Sebastian,fall_Wed,*yawn*... what time is it? I think I slept too much last night.
Sebastian,fall_Wed8,"Now I feel a lot more energetic, believe it or not.$eI'm glad you showed up. I was starting to get bored."
Sebastian,fall_Thu,My room might be a little less depressing if I had a window...$s

Sebastian,fall_Fri_good,"Hey, me too. There's nothing like a good fiction to push the boundaries of the imagination.$h"
Sebastian,fall_Fri_bad,Huh. Sounds boring.
Sebastian,fall_Fri6,"Sorry if that creeps you out.$h$eI've been reading a book about a farmer. Reminds me a lot of you, actually.$h"
Sebastian,fall_Sat,"I was *this* close to moping in bed the entire day. Kinda wish I had, now."
Sebastian,fall_Sun,The sun is coming out less and less these days... wonderful.
Sebastian,winter_Mon,"I'm enjoying this gloomy weather... although I have to say, it's a little cold."
Sebastian,winter_Mon4,"Yeah, I know... I'm being a little dramatic.$eNothing surprises me anymore... nothing makes me laugh."
Sebastian,winter_Tue,Hmm... I don't really have anything to say. I still don't know you very well.
Sebastian,winter_Tue4,"...Sorry.$eIt's hard to think of new things to talk about, sometimes. Even after you know someone.$bHey..."
Sebastian,winter_Tue6,Hmm... with age comes wisdom.$eI was so close to screaming at Mom for throwing away my old comic collection... But something stopped me.
Sebastian,winter_Tue10,...$h$eYou came here to see me?$l
Sebastian,winter_Wed,%Sebastian seems lost in thought...
Sebastian,winter_Wed4,"If you aren't busy I don't mind if you stick around.$h$eHey, don't let me stop you from getting your work done."
Sebastian,winter_Thu,I wonder what's for dinner tonight... *grumble*$s
Sebastian,winter_Thu6,I should learn how to cook. That would be useful.
Sebastian,winter_Fri,It's fun to live so close to the train tracks. It's a reminder that there's a big world out there.
Sebastian,winter_Fri8,Whatever happened to those days...? *sigh*$s$eWhen I was younger I'd run out to the railroad whenever I heard a train coming.
Sebastian,winter_Sat,Poor little guys.$s$eThe frogs aren't very happy in winter.
Sebastian,winter_Sat6,"I guess they're used to it, though... like me.$eI like winter but I do feel bad for all the cold animals out there."
Sebastian,winter_Sun,What's his problem?$u$eI built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it.
Sebastian,winter_Sun6,Ridiculous.$eI built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it... yet Maru's cute little snowman goes unharmed!$a
Shane,Mon,I don't know you. Why are you talking to me?
Shane,Resort_Entering,Buh... hope the bar's open.
Shane,Resort_Leaving,Welp... got my year's supply of Vitamin D. Now I can play video games with the blinds shut the rest of the year.
Shane,Resort_Shore,"The crabs seem to enjoy it, though.$h$bSome call it a public health risk.$bThat's right... I'm not wearing any shoes or socks."
Shane,Resort_Chair,"If anyone needs me, I'll just be sitting here, marinating.$bHoo... Feels good to rest these hams."

Shane,divorced,...Leave me alone.$a$e...$a
Shane,breakUp,"I'll... uh... guess I'll see you at the Saloon.$b*gulp* Oh... Yeah, okay... I guess I should've seen this coming.$s"
Shane,dumped_Guys,%Shane has a glazed look in his eye. He won't speak to you.
Shane,secondChance_Guys,I don't understand you... *sigh*...
Shane,Mon2,I hardly know you. Why are you talking to me?
Shane,Mon4,It takes me a while to warm up to strangers.$eHey. Sorry if I came off as rude when we first met.
Shane,Mon10,Do you ever feel like the whole world is scrutinizing you like some disgusting insect?
Shane,Tue,What? What do you want? Go away.
Shane,Tue2,What do you want from me? Money? I'd give you a pot of gold to leave me alone!
Shane,Tue4,Every time I try something new it goes horribly wrong. You learn to just stay in a shell.
Shane,Tue6,Life isn't so bad... at least I have frozen pizza and eggs.$u
Shane,Wed,"No, I don't have time to chat with you."
Shane,Wed8,I never really had much of a family as a kid.$s$eI guess I've grown attached to Marnie and Jas. We're a ragtag bunch but it kind of feels like a weird family.
Shane,Wed4,"*sigh* ...Every day is the same. Stocking those horrible shelves, going to the saloon, tossing and turning all night.$s|I hated my job at JojaMart, but now that I'm unemployed I feel even worse.$s$d Joja"
Shane,Thu,What do you want? Leave me alone.
Shane,Thu4,You're really persistent. I guess I'm just surprised that anyone would be interested in talking to me.
Shane,Thu6,Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?
Shane,Thu8,You like talking to me? I guess I believe you... maybe you're as weird as I am.$h
Shane,Fri,Don't you have work to do?
Shane,JojaMart,%Shane's hard at work. He doesn't seem interested in talking.
Shane,Fri4,"What's the point of life if all you do is work?|I haven't been able to pay my rent, but Marnie's letting me stay anyway. I'm lucky.$d Joja"
Shane,Fri6,I'll definitely be going to the saloon tonight. What else is there to do?
Shane,Sat,Why are you bothering me? I want to be alone.
Shane,Sat2,*sigh*...$s$eI'm surprised that you're still trying to make friends with me. Haven't I been rude enough to you yet?$1 ShaneJOSH
Shane,Sat4,I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain.|If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.$d Joja
Shane,Sat8,I've really grown attached to Marnie's chickens.$h
Shane,Sun,"I'm busy, can't you tell?"
Shane,Sun6,...I think I might be gaining weight.$s
Shane,Sun8,If I watch more TV maybe I can forget about life. That would be relaxing.$u
Shane,Sun10,"Hi, @. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far.$h"
Shane,Sun4,"Hmm... it's %time. Should I throw a frozen pizza in the microwave, or should I wait?$u"
Shane,Sun2,You again? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone?$s
Shane,event_room1,Okay... that'll require a great script. Maybe I'll ask Elliott for advice next time I see him at the saloon.$s
Shane,event_room2,Sounds great. I'll have to create a bunch of practical effects to make it look cool.
Shane,event_noLoan1,I didn't know you were such a miser...$s
Shane,event_noLoan2,"Okay, Dad...$s^Okay, Mom...$s"
Shane,event_noLoan3,"Oh, wow...$s"
Shane,event_apologize1,"...Yeah, me too."
Shane,event_apologize2,"I know... that's why I stopped by, to tell you about it."
Shane,event_apologize3,"Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..."
Shane,event_stadium1,But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out.$l$bMe? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes.$bOh yeah? I guess that makes sense.$6
Shane,event_stadium2,"I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know.$bOh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city?$6"
