ExtraDialogue,SummitEvent_Dialogue3_Shane,"I have no regrets marrying you!  Uh.. I guess what I want to say is...

,Rainy_Day_3,"Maybe I'll make something hot for dinner. I don't want to go outside in this weather... I'll just do some things around the house. What's on your agenda today, dear?"
,Rainy_Day_4,Any dinner requests for tonight?
,Rainy_Day_Maru,"Despite all the technology we have, a rainy day is still the best tool for watering crops."
,Rainy_Day_Abigail,"The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?"
,Rainy_Day_Penny,I think I might do some baking today. 
,Rainy_Day_Leah,"Might want to do some fishing or mining today, huh?"
,Rainy_Day_Haley,Hmmph. If this weather keeps up I'll get too pale. 
,Rainy_Day_Harvey,"Make sure you stay dry today, dear. I don't want you to become hypothermic."
,Rainy_Day_Sebastian,I got up just before dawn and took a walk around the farm. It's really peaceful at that hour.
,Rainy_Day_Alex,Hmm... I guess I'll have to do push-ups and sit-ups indoors today.
,Rainy_Day_Elliott,Change is part of life. That's okay. The rain makes me think of my old life by the ocean.
,Rainy_Day_Sam,I might spend some time today fixing any leaks in the roof or the windows.
,Rainy_Day_Emily,"I know you pride yourself on your work, but don't overdo it today. Okay, honey? "
,Rainy_Day_Shane,The roof's leaking? Ah well... a little mold never hurt anyone.
,Rainy_Night_0,I'm cold... Aren't you ready to tuck into bed?  The rain makes it feel like we're all alone. 
,Rainy_Night_1,"Can you hear the rain pattering on the roof, @? Make sure you change into something warm. I don't want you to get sick."
,Rainy_Night_2,Ah...The soothing sound of rain overhead... I'm going to sleep well tonight. 
,Rainy_Night_3,The rain makes our home seem so cozy. ^It's nights like this I'm glad we have a quality roof.
,Rainy_Night_4,You need something hot on a day like this!  I made some soup for dinner. [199 218 219 727 730] 
,Rainy_Night_5,I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to stay inside.
,Rainy_Night_Maru,"I tried to fix up some things around the house... you know, just little stuff. Were you able to accomplish much today, hun?"
,Rainy_Night_Abigail,I'm ready to hop into bed whenever you are. The sound of rain will put us right to sleep.
,Rainy_Night_Penny,Oh... the smell? I tried to do some baking... It didn't work out too well. 
,Rainy_Night_Leah,"How was your day today, dear? Muddy?"
,Rainy_Night_Haley,"Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely. "
,Rainy_Night_Harvey,I spent the day skimming through some medical journals. Hi. It's good to see you. 
,Rainy_Night_Sebastian,I'll never grow tired of the rain... especially out here in the countryside.
,Rainy_Night_Alex,Grandma always used to make hot stew on nights like this. 
,Rainy_Night_Elliott,"Sit down, relax! You've got to be tired after trudging through the mud all day."
,Rainy_Night_Sam,Vincent called. He said he misses me and also to tell you hi. 
,Rainy_Night_Shane,I just got off the phone with Jas and Marnie. They seem to be having a pretty good time without me.
,Rainy_Night_Emily,Certain spirits only appear in the rain. Maybe you've heard their cries?
,Indoor_Day_0,Ready for a hard day's work? I am.  Good morning ~< 
,Indoor_Day_1,"You need food to stay energized throughout the day. Hi, honey! Smells good, doesn't it? I made you breakfast! [194 195 210 211 216]"
,Indoor_Day_2,I've got some chores to do in here. Did you sleep well?
,Indoor_Day_3,"Well, we can't spend all day chit-chatting. You have work to do! Hehe. Dreams don't mean anything... do they, Honey?  I did, but all I remember is that it had something to do with a  . Weird.  Did you have any strange dreams last night?"
,Indoor_Day_4,"I'll be cheering for you. <  Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh?"
,Indoor_Day_Maru,If you ever want to talk about how to maximize crop yield or anything... I'm open to that!
,Indoor_Day_Abigail,There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it.
,Indoor_Day_Penny,"This place is so big compared to the trailer, I feel overwhelmed... In a good way!"
,Indoor_Day_Leah,Mind if I add some architectural flair to the woodwork around here? My chisel hand is itching!
,Indoor_Day_Haley,I always feel happy on a sunny day. 
,Indoor_Day_Harvey,"From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home! The sky looks great today... so clear!"
,Indoor_Day_Sebastian,"Well, this place sure beats my old basement room, doesn't it? "
,Indoor_Day_Alex,The sun's shining and I'm bursting with energy! You'd better watch out! Heh Heh. 
,Indoor_Day_Elliott,"I want to make sure I always remember these years. I've been keeping a journal ever since we moved in together. Now that I actually have a life, I have lots to write about. "
,Indoor_Day_Sam,There's too much stuff I want to get done today... Maybe I'll just watch TV instead.
,Indoor_Day_Emily,"By providing fresh, healthy produce to the community, we're doing a great service!"
,Indoor_Day_Shane,It's just this old corn chip I put in my pocket a few weeks ago.  There's something special in the air... ... what is that? Oh...
,Indoor_Night_0,"I'm ready for bed whenever you are.  I did some house chores... but now I'm so tired. Did you get everything done today, @?"
,Indoor_Night_1,"Now you should just relax and kick back for the night.  Wow, you look like you did a lot of work today."
,Indoor_Night_2,...  I get kind of scared alone at night. ^I get lonely at night...  I'm glad you're home.
,Indoor_Night_3,But if you're tired I understand. Are you done with your work for the day? I'm ready to have some fun. 
,Indoor_Night_4,"...  So, tell me about your day.  ! I just finished my chores. Now we can spend some time together. "
,Indoor_Night_Maru,"... To be honest, I'm kind of sleepy too. You look like you're ready for bed, @. Should I lull you to sleep with the technical details of my latest project? "
,Indoor_Night_Abigail,Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us... 
,Indoor_Night_Penny,"Hi there, honey. Ready to spend a quiet evening at home?"
,Indoor_Night_Leah,It's so quiet and peaceful in the evening. Nothing to distract you from the experience of living.
,Indoor_Night_Haley,"You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress. "
,Indoor_Night_Harvey,Doctor's orders... It's good for the circulation! You look like you could use a good massage tonight. 
,Indoor_Night_Sebastian,"Hi, @. Good to see you. It's comforting when you're around.  I may be a reclusive guy, but I'm always happy when you're around.   .5"
,Indoor_Night_Alex,"My arms feel a little restless... How about a nice, deep massage? ^I feel exhausted... That's a good sign! It means I worked hard enough today. "
,Indoor_Night_Elliott,"Come here, let me massage your back. You look tense. ^You smell sweet, my dear. Like a cinnamon leaf floating in the summer breeze. You always smell so good after a day of hard work. It's your natural musk!^You smell sweet, my dear. Like a honeycomb drifting on a pool of spice tea.  .5"
,Indoor_Night_Sam,"So, did you get everything done on the farm today? If you didn't I won't be mad! I wonder if the moon is visible tonight?  .5"
,Indoor_Night_Emily,It's a very cozy house... I like it.
,Indoor_Night_Shane,How was your day? Mine actually went pretty well.
,Outdoor_0,"Days like this make work a little more pleasant. It's a beautiful day today, isn't it? "
,Outdoor_1,"It's just such a nice-looking area.  I'm just going to relax and inspect the farm today, okay?"
,Outdoor_2,"I'll be thinking of you.  Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!"
,Outdoor_3,"... it's hot out here. I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right?"
,Outdoor_4,"Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.  Don't overwork yourself, dear."
,Outdoor_Maru,I'm still hoping to come up with something to help you out in your work. I like being out here. It's a good place to think about new inventions. 
,Outdoor_Abigail,"There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here.   I'm just going to hang out here, okay?"
,Outdoor_Haley,"Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart? "
,Outdoor_Leah,"This is the life I've always dreamed of.  Wow, this is great! I'm really starting to enjoy life on the farm, @. "
,Outdoor_Penny,"I'm really happy on our little farm, @. "
,Outdoor_Sebastian,"I feel like I really belong here.  This is so different from my old life, but I'm really starting to like it. "
,Outdoor_Harvey,I love watching you on the farm... hehe This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day. 
,Outdoor_Elliott,"This is perfect.  Today, I'm going to continue writing my new novel. What better place than our wonderful farm? "
,Outdoor_Alex,I'm going to get a bunch of exercise today! Haha! I love living on a farm. 
,Outdoor_Sam,"I'm going to watch those for a while, if you don't mind. Hey, look at those puffy clouds in the sky, honey! "
,Outdoor_Shane,I dunno if my lungs can handle this freshness. I'm still used to JojaAir.
,Outdoor_Emily,"You're doing great work, @. Keep it up."
,jobLeave_Harvey,"I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?"
,jobLeave_Penny,"I have to go into town today. Don't work too hard, and eat something good for lunch! "
,jobLeave_Maru,I have to leave for work soon. I'll see you tonight. I'll be thinking of you! 
,jobReturn_Harvey,"My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day. ... I'm exhausted...  Hi, honey. How was your day?  .5"
,jobReturn_Penny,"Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up... Good evening. My day was fine, thanks! How was yours?   .5"
,jobReturn_Maru,"I'm just looking forward to bed-time.  Well, It's time to kick back and relax. Did you leave me any dinner?  .5 Hey. Did you have a more exciting day than me? I hope so. Well, it was just another boring day at the clinic.  .5"
,OneKid_0,Have you spent any time with  today?
,OneKid_1,I wonder if  will grow up to be a farmer like you?
,OneKid_2,"Don't worry, I'll feed  today. You can just focus on running the farm."
,OneKid_3,Life's a lot different now that we have a child.
,TwoKids_0,I already gave  and  their breakfast. They were hungry!
,TwoKids_1,We have to make sure and give  a lot of attention now that we have . We don't want any jealousy between them.
,TwoKids_2,"You know, I think  has your nose."
,TwoKids_3,"A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. What's left?"
,Good_0,It's hard to believe we're finally married... 
,Good_1,"You know, I always had a feeling we'd be together some day. "
,Good_2,"I am.  Are you enjoying the married life, @?"
,Good_3,"Wow, you look really handsome today! ^Wow, you look beautiful today. "
,Good_4,This place is my home now... I'm happy here. 
,Good_5,I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. It must have cost you a fortune! 
,Good_6,Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry about you falling into a mine shaft.
,Good_7,@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household. 
,Good_8,Don't worry about me... I know you've got a lot of responsibilities outside of the house. I'm fine in here by myself! 
,Good_9,"It's a simple life, but I like it.  Oh, I'm not bored... I'm just enjoying what we have here."
,Neutral_0,I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and gray. 
,Neutral_1,Do you think your grandpa would be proud of the work we've done?
,Neutral_2,Taking a break? I guess being a farmer is easier than I thought...
,Neutral_3,"If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me."
,Neutral_4,I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time.
,Neutral_5,"Are we doing okay on money, @?"
,Neutral_6,I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?
,Neutral_7,I don't really feel like doing anything today.
,Neutral_8,"I guess farms can be kind of dirty. No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again."
,Neutral_9,I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?
,Bad_0,...Do you still love me? 
,Bad_1,... Maybe we got married too young. 
,Bad_2,Are you still happy with me?s
,Bad_3,Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately. 
,Bad_4,Do you ever wonder what else is out there? 
,Bad_5,I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for?  You used to be romantic... what happened? 
,Bad_6,We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it? 
,Bad_7,I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner. 
,Bad_8,You've been so cold to me lately... 
,Bad_9,I wonder if I could've done better. 
,spring_1,"I feel pretty hopeful. Well, a new year has arrived. Do you have a plan for what you want to accomplish this year?"
,spring_8,"Now that winter's over, we've got lots of productive weather to look forward to."
,spring_23,I hope you've been practicing your moves... tomorrow is the flower dance!
,summer_1,"Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself. Make sure you don't get a heat stroke, dear."
,summer_8,Sorry if I smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.
,summer_15,"Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's summer... that means the house is full of flies."
,fall_1,This weather feels pretty nice after the heat of summer.
,fall_8,"Don't worry, I'll take care of it all. Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house."
,fall_15,Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?
,fall_26,Should we go to the Spirit's Eve festival tomorrow night?
,winter_1,Brrr.... It's cold. I guess winter has arrived.
,winter_7,Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?
,winter_28,"Thanks for a great year, @. I'm excited to tackle next year together. "
,spring_Maru,"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @! "
,spring_Abigail,"I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive."
,spring_Haley,"Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now."
,spring_Leah,"Don't forget to look for wild horseradish, leeks and dandelions while you're out there!"
,spring_Penny,I'm so happy to see some greenery after that long white winter.
,spring_Sebastian,"Wow, my skin is pale... I guess I'd better help you with some farm work this season."
,spring_Harvey,Let's plant some healthy vegetables this spring. 
,spring_Elliott,I'm looking forward to a beautiful year on  farm. 
,spring_Alex,Hey @. Let's work hard today!
,spring_Sam, ... My doze is stubbed up... allergies.
,spring_Shane,Maybe I'll learn a new skill this year...
,summer_Maru,It's a good time of year to do some stargazing.
,summer_Abigail,Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake.
,summer_Haley,You must know by now that summer is my favorite season. 
,summer_Leah,"Nothing pairs so well with summer like a nice sweet wine. Don't you think, honey?"
,summer_Penny,Are you growing any melons this summer?
,summer_Sebastian,I'm going to stay inside as much as possible this summer.
,summer_Harvey,"Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin."
,summer_Elliott,One of the main things I miss about the ocean is the fresh fish.
,summer_Alex,I always have the most energy in the summer.
,summer_Sam,Summer always makes me want to eat more barbecue.
,summer_Emily,"Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today. Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it?"
,summer_Shane,I think I see some spicy pretzel snacks and a couple of 'cold boys' on the horizon. What's on my agenda today... hmmm... 
,fall_Maru,I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community.
,fall_Abigail,I hope we're growing pumpkins this year. 
,fall_Haley,But not just any cake... it has to be pink. I'm craving cake.
,fall_Leah,Breathe deep... can you smell that? That tells me it's mushroom season.
,fall_Penny,It's so peaceful out here on the farm. I never appreciated nature that much living in town.
,fall_Sebastian,My mother used to always make this delicious pumpkin soup in the fall.
,fall_Harvey,I could sure go for some wine.
,fall_Elliott,"It's a beautiful time of year, don't you think? Ah... Fall. The warm sun drifts low in the sky, casting long shadows over waving fields of gold."
,fall_Alex,I feel weak... I need some protein. 
,fall_Sam,I wonder what's going on in the rest of the world? We're really secluded here.
,fall_Emily,I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing! 
,fall_Shane,"Ah well, 'tis the season, right? I think there might be a new species of fungus growing behind my mini-fridge."
,winter_Maru,Spring is coming soon. I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie.
,winter_Abigail,"Remember when we played that 'Prairie King' game together, in my room? Those were good times. "
,winter_Haley,We've come a long way since then.  I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles. 
,winter_Leah,"I always start craving salad in the winter... Inconvenient, I know."
,winter_Penny,I'm going to do a lot of reading this winter.
,winter_Sebastian,I wonder what Sam's up to? We used to be really good friends.
,winter_Harvey,"Winter is flu season, so work is probably going to be a lot more stressful. Sorry in advance if I'm grouchy."
,winter_Elliott,"I think I might do some writing this winter. There's not much else to do, anyway."
,winter_Alex,"I hope my grandparents are doing okay. They used to rely on my help quite a bit. You know, with lifting heavy objects or whatever."
,winter_Sam,I've given up on being a musician. I'm a family man now!
,winter_Emily,"Whoops, my hair is frozen solid again. "
,winter_Shane,"There's a wide, wide world out there... but I'd rather stay in my room."
,spouseRoom_Maru,"I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey. I got up early to do a little star-gazing.  .5"
,spouseRoom_Abigail,I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell. I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.  .5
,spouseRoom_Haley,"Have any plans for the day? Go ahead and start your day, honey. I'm just putting on my make-up.  .5"
,spouseRoom_Leah,"The view from this window is inspiring, don't you think? One of these days I'll have to do your portrait.  .5"
,spouseRoom_Penny,I like to do a little reading first thing in the morning. It gets my brain into gear. I always wanted my very own library. This is so charming.   .5
,spouseRoom_Sebastian,"Hey, do we have any pizza in the freezer? I'm hungry. I'm debating whether I should work or just read comics all day.  .5"
,spouseRoom_Harvey,"I'm working on a new model plane. It's so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment. No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it's still fun to break out the equipment now and then.  .5"
,spouseRoom_Elliott,Will you be okay without my help? I think I might do some writing today.  .5
,spouseRoom_Alex,There's lots of room here to do my exercises. I'm making more progress than ever! Don't ever let me get lazy. I want to stay in good shape for you!  .5
,spouseRoom_Sam,What's on your agenda today? The old guitar... I don't have as much drive to play it anymore. That's fine.  .5
,spouseRoom_Emily,I'm going to spend some time with the parrot today. It breaks my heart that he'll never fly again. 
,spouseRoom_Shane,"Hi, @. I'll just hang out in here today and uh... maybe sweep the floor a little bit or something. Beer or cider? Sometimes life can be challenging.  .5"
,Rainy_Day_Krobus,"Ah, It's more humid today with the rain... I feel a lot more comfortable."
,Rainy_Night_Krobus,"The sewers were my refuge... I felt safe there. But don't worry... I feel the same way about my new home, too. The sound of the rain reminds me of the sewers... it's comforting."
,Indoor_Day_Krobus,"I wish I could help you on the farm, but I can't go out in the sun..."
,Indoor_Night_Krobus,"Hi, @. Welcome home. You look like you've been working hard out there! "
,Outdoor_Krobus,"Just let me know if you see anyone coming, so I can hide.  On a day like this, I can enjoy the outdoors with you. This is really nice! "
,NoBed_0,Where am I supposed to sleep...? 
,NoBed_1,I wasn't able to sleep well last night... 
,NoBed_2,I had to sleep on the floor last night... 
,NoBed_3,Did something happen to our bed...?

rainy,Abigail,The valley looks more interesting in the rain... don't you think?
rainy,Robin,Although soggy wood isn't a joy to work with.  The rain doesn't stop me from getting a job done! 
rainy,Demetrius,Greetings. Stay inside if you want to keep warm.
rainy,Maru,"It must be kind of boring for you, though. When it rains I have a good excuse to work on my gadgets all day. "
rainy,Sebastian,"If you're lucky, you might see a frog in this weather."
rainy,Linus,A warm rain is a pleasant way to get clean. 
rainy,Pierre,Most people stay indoors on days like this... It's not good for business. 
rainy,Caroline,...and our water bill will be lower this month. My garden is happy today. 
rainy,Alex,"Oh well, I can always lift weights inside.  Hmmph. This is not good weather for sports. "
rainy,George,"It's awful cold, isn't it? What a rotten day."
rainy,Evelyn,"In the old days, George would've scampered right up and fixed it...   When I woke up I heard dripping from somewhere... I think the roof might be leaking. "
rainy,Lewis,"I hope the river doesn't overflow...  Hi there, @. Taking a break?"
rainy,Clint,"Today would be a good day to explore the mines... Who knows, you might find some rare ores."
rainy,Penny,"...It's soothing, though.  The raindrops are really loud on the metal roof of our trailer."
rainy,Pam,"Howdy, kid. Stayin' dry?"
rainy,Emily,I wish I could've visited her today.  It never rains in Calico Desert... That's where my friend Sandy lives.
rainy,Haley, ... Life is hard sometimes. I spent all morning doing my hair... now the rain could mess it up. 
rainy,Jodi,But you're always welcome in here! Heh.  Did you wipe your boots off before coming in? Sorry... I just cleaned the floor.
rainy,Sam,"Rain muffles sound, so I can play my guitar louder without my Mom getting mad. Hehe. "
rainy,Leah,Maybe I should cook something new and exciting today. Something spicy.
rainy,Shane,Hmm... this weather makes me thirsty. 
rainy,Marnie,Hi @. You look like you're soaked...you poor thing! 
rainy,Elliott,But when I look out the window I see only a curtain of gray. Sometimes when I lay in bed I can hear a distant foghorn cut through the rain.
rainy,Gus,"I love my job. Hehehe. There's nothing like a glass of dry red wine on a day like this, huh?"
rainy,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us dwarves live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.
rainy,Wizard,I don't expect you to understand. Stormy days are the only time I can commune with certain elementals.
rainy,Harvey,"Heh. Well, um... I'll see you around then?  Hi @! Er... Read anything interesting in the library lately?"
rainy,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
rainy,Krobus,"Ah, the sewers are flowing quickly today. It'll get nice and humid in here... Just how I like it."
rainy,Leo,"To me... nature is someone I know, with different moods. The valley is peaceful when it rains."
