fall16,Abigail_spouse,I beat all these games last year! 
fall16,Leah_spouse,"I learned all of Robin's techniques last year, but she's always one step ahead of me!"
fall16,Maru_spouse,mumph... This is my one chance to pig out on barbecue sandwiches.
fall16,Penny_spouse,I hope we win the grange display contest!
fall16,Haley_spouse,Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year.
fall16,Sebastian_spouse,"Hey, @. I'm just catching up with Sam. Go ahead and have some fun."
fall16,Sam_spouse,Sebastian's the same as always. Are you having fun at the festival?
fall16,Alex_spouse,I'm just catching up with some old friends... you go on and have a good time.
fall16,Harvey_spouse,I'll wait here until you're ready to go home...
fall16,Elliott_spouse,"The smokey aroma drew me here, yet 'twas the zesty sauce that truly sealed my fate...  "
fall16,Abigail,I already beat all the games... now what?
fall16,Robin,Woodworking is an ancient tradition that I'm very proud to be a part of. 
fall16,Demetrius,Robin really works hard on her carpentry stuff... she deserves a little recognition now and then.
fall16,Maru, mmm... this barbecue sauce is amazing. 
fall16,Sebastian,It's kinda hectic today... I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.
fall16,Pierre,"My store carries the very finest quality products in the whole valley. Please, inspect my grange display closely and see for yourself!"
fall16,Caroline,"Hey, best of luck to you if you enter! Pierre is very serious about his grange display. He's been setting aside the best-looking produce for weeks in preparation."
fall16,Linus,These animals never judge people by their looks. The same can't be said for humans.
fall16,Alex,I played the 'Strength' game too many times and now my arms feel like rubber.
fall16,George,Hmm... smoked turkey haunch? I guess this festival isn't all bad. 
fall16,Evelyn,"I wish Gus would include a vegetarian option. Some zucchini skewers, maybe?"
fall16,Lewis,"If you'd like to participate by setting up a grange display, I've left an empty stand for you. Just let me know after you've set everything up so we can get to the judging. Well @, It's the big day... Our most important festival of the year, the 'Stardew Valley Fair'."
fall16,Clint,"These are some of my finest pieces. I hope you like them. I complain about my job sometimes, but I do take pride in my work."
fall16,Emily,"You know, I would've made a pretty good clown. I think I missed my calling."
fall16,Penny,I won the wheel of chance ten times in a row and now the man won't let me play anymore... 
fall16,Pam,"Better hurry up, kid... Before ol' Pam here fishes every last lunker out of the tent! Hehe. "
fall16,Haley,I already saw her... she told me something... interesting.   Have you been to the fortune teller? She set up her stand in the graveyard.
fall16,Jodi,He doesn't look very happy... I guess Mayor Lewis had to cut costs with a budget clown this year.
fall16,Kent,Pretty disappointing. I'm waiting for this clown to start doing something funny.
fall16,Sam,"The slingshot tent is pretty fun, and if you get good at it you can really rack up the star tokens. Hey @. Having a good time?"
fall16,Leah,I really admire Robin's carpentry skills. I use a lot of the same techniques in my own line of work.
fall16,Shane,All these animals are friendly and love to get massaged.
fall16,Marnie,"Well, maybe the judges will give me bonus points for the massive cheese wheel. I tried my best, but my display is pretty weak compared to Pierre's. "
fall16,Elliott,"I'm trying to get Gus to tell me his sauce recipe, but he won't budge."
fall16,Gus,Oh! Make sure to dribble some of my secret sauce on there. Eat as much as you like! It's all free today... compliments of Mayor Lewis. 
fall16,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
fall16,Wizard,"Was it the school of illusion? Or maybe the Carnival of Secrets? Hmm... That clown... I know him from somewhere. ... Welwick and I have known each other for a long time... she is a remarkable diviner, and a good friend."
fall16,Harvey,"I've got some soul-searching to do... 1 And just a few steps over there, Gus is grilling up a batch of pork ribs... Yikes. "
fall16,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
fall16,Jas,Ow! A hen pecked my little finger! 
fall16,Vincent,Moooo!
fall16,Marlon,So do his prices... Clint's blades get sharper every year.
fall16,Willy,"Are you setting up a grange display, @? It's your chance to show off all the good produce from !"
fall16,Leo,Haha! I've never seen anything like this before...

fall27,Abigail_spouse,"You'll have to tell me what's beyond, I can't go on... spiders... "
fall27,Leah_spouse,I may have had a little too much pumpkin ale...
fall27,Maru_spouse,I'm confused... you go on ahead and let me figure this out.
fall27,Penny_spouse,Oh... These vapors... Hmmm... You look nice tonight. 
fall27,Haley_spouse,I get scared easily... I think I'm just going to stay right here. 
fall27,Sebastian_spouse,It would be interesting to have one of these on the farm.
fall27,Sam_spouse,"Hey, I was wondering when you'd show up! "
fall27,Harvey_spouse,Hi... I was hoping you'd find me here... 
fall27,Elliott_spouse,Mmph... I believe I've eaten a few too many slices of pumpkin pie.
fall27,Abigail,I can't go on... spiders... 
fall27,Robin,"Well, winter's almost here. It's a great time to stockpile wood and stone."
fall27,Demetrius,I haven't seen Maru in hours... I hope she's alright.
fall27,Maru,"I'm lost...  I think I've already been this way... no, wait... "
fall27,Sebastian,It's pretty cool though. I have no idea how these skeletons are walking... creepy.
fall27,Pierre,??
fall27,Caroline,I get scared very easily. I'll leave the haunted maze to the younger people.
fall27,Linus,"Good show, old friend."
fall27,Alex,There's gotta be a secret passage somewhere around here. There's something weird over there. But how do I get to it?
fall27,George,Hmm... smoked turkey haunch? I guess this festival isn't all bad. 
fall27,Evelyn,"I wish Gus would include a vegetarian option. Some zucchini skewers, maybe?"
fall27,Lewis,"That strange man who lives in the tower set it all up himself. He wouldn't let anyone near while he was working on it. Good evening, @. Have you ventured into the haunted maze yet? It's quite spooky."
fall27,Clint,One of my iridium-infused maces would make quick work of these things.
fall27,Emily,Do you like the jack-o-lanterns? I carved them myself.
fall27,Penny,"The vapor from this cauldron... it's making my head spin, but I can't seem to leave... "
fall27,Pam,"I'll come to any event with free grub! You won't see me in the haunted maze, though."
fall27,Haley,Eek! I'm too scared. 
fall27,Jodi,Vincent's upset that I won't let him go into the haunted maze... but he's just a little boy!
fall27,Kent,"Hey, @. Nice evening, isn't it?"
fall27,Sam,"I could've sworn there was someone ahead of me when I went through the maze, though. Where'd they go? That's odd... It's just a dead end up ahead."
fall27,Leah,"Mm, hi. Sorry... mouth full of blackberries."
fall27,Marnie,"It's starting to get quite cold... crops won't hold out for much longer. Hi, @. Have you had a productive fall?"
fall27,Elliott,"Why, hello @. It's chilly, isn't it?"
fall27,Gus,It's a lot of fun to cook with pumpkin. Such an interesting fruit.
fall27,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
fall27,Wizard,"It was for them that I created this silly maze. The affairs of mundane folk matter little to me, but the elementals like a chance to see you up close."
fall27,Harvey,"The truth is, I got too scared so I came here to hide. Don't tell anyone.  Oh! You found me... "
fall27,Shane,Why is there no more pumpkin ale?
fall27,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
fall27,Jas,But Aunt Marnie! I wanna go in the maze! I'm not scared! 
fall27,Vincent,Mother won't let me go in the maze.  
fall27,Marlon,Don't get too close to the cage.
fall27,Leo,'s unblinking eyes are glued to the screen. You're unable to get his attention.

spring13,Abigail_spouse,"Go away, we're adversaries until the egg hunt is over! "
spring13,Leah_spouse,"I never had many friends in town, so these events are always kind of boring for me. I enjoy the buffet, though."
spring13,Maru_spouse,I'm just catching up with Penny. Have you had your fill of eggs?
spring13,Penny_spouse,Maru's trying to convince me to eat a deviled egg. I'm just not sure I can stomach it...
spring13,Haley_spouse,"I was going to eat some eggs, but then I remembered I'm on a spring diet."
spring13,Sebastian_spouse,I'll be rooting for you in the egg hunt. 
spring13,Sam_spouse,The gang's just the same as always. Are you having a good time?
spring13,Alex_spouse,Ungh... I think I ate a dozen too many hard boiled eggs... 
spring13,Harvey_spouse,How is everyone doing? I'm just taking a break for a little while. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the egg hunt!
spring13,Elliott_spouse,"I enjoy seeing you so relaxed, my dear. "
spring13,Abigail,Searching for eggs is like going on a treasure hunt. 
spring13,Robin,Spring is a busy time of year... so it's nice to have a day off to catch up with friends.
spring13,Demetrius,Egg... what a strange thing to eat.
spring13,Maru,I always look forward to these gatherings... it makes the valley feel like a real community.
spring13,Sebastian,Mayor Lewis put an end to that pretty quick. We used to do a rotten egg toss...
spring13,Linus,No one really talks to me... I just come for the deviled eggs.
spring13,Pierre,Don't touch anything. Hey! How'd you get back here? 
spring13,Caroline,"Abby's always loved the egg hunt, ever since she was a tiny girl."
spring13,Alex,I need that protein for my legs. I try to eat at least three eggs every day.
spring13,George,Eggs... why eggs? What's everyone so happy about? Hmmph...
spring13,Evelyn,Tradition connects us with both the past and the future... it's comforting. This festival has been a tradition for as long as I can remember.
spring13,Lewis,"Enjoying yourself, @? "
spring13,Clint,Is there any more food? 
spring13,Penny,The children have been looking forward to this festival for weeks.
spring13,Pam,"Shhh... that's just between you and me, kid. Hehe... I put something nice into the punch. "
spring13,Emily,I've been up since dawn coloring eggs... it's always my favorite part of the season. 
spring13,Haley,This festival is alright... but what I'm really looking foward to is the Flower Dance.
spring13,Jodi,Vincent loves this festival... it's a joy to see him so happy.
spring13,Kent,"I'm not a big fan of eggs, to tell you the truth."
spring13,Marlon,"Even with my bad leg, I never miss a town festival."
spring13,Sam,... ub... my doze... allergies... 
spring13,Leah,Mmmm... This fruit punch is unusually good. 
spring13,Shane,They deserve the best tonight... bowls full of sweet yellow corn!  Our hens have been working overtime to prepare for this festival.
spring13,Marnie,Welcome to the Egg Festival... complements of my wonderful brood of hens.
spring13,Elliott,Taking breaks from work can make you more productive in the long run.
spring13,Gus,"Fried eggs, boiled eggs, poached eggs, deviled eggs, scrambled eggs, chocolate eggs... you name it!  I hope everyone's enjoying the food... I've been cooking for days to get everything ready."
spring13,Dwarf,Rain... it's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
spring13,Wizard,Hmm... And what about raw lizard egg sprinkled with blackened marrow?
spring13,Harvey,Oops... I should take off my Doctor's hat for the time being. 1 Eggs definitely have a place in the well-balanced diet.
spring13,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
spring13,Jas,I hope I can find some eggs before Vincent takes them all... 
spring13,Vincent,When does the egg hunt start?! I'm so excited!! 
spring13,Willy,"Well, until summer rolls around. Then the hot air starts to bring out the rotten smell... Hehe.   Sometimes I'll hide an egg too well and no one finds it..."
spring13,???,"Ah, the sewers are flowing quickly today. It'll get nice and humid in here... just how I like it."
spring13,Leo,"Oh well, I'll join in anyway!  The idea of an egg hunt is a little bit weird... but I guess the eggs don't belong to any of my family members... "
spring13,Abigail_y2,"  'Do you think I'm too old to do the egg hunt?_Yes_Hmmph... you sound like my Mom! _No_Yeah, I guess so. If I'm still having fun, why stop?'"
spring13,Robin_y2,"It feels great to be outside again after that long, cold winter, doesn't it?"
spring13,Demetrius_y2,"...What? It is the 'egg' festival, isn't it? Hey @, did you get a taste of my carp roe pie?"
spring13,Maru_y2,Think you'll win the egg hunt this year?
spring13,Sebastian_y2,"You know what? I kind of miss the winter... it's simpler, in a way."
spring13,Linus_y2,I'll just slip in a little later and have some food. I'm eyeing that scrumptious looking pie!
spring13,Pierre_y2,"Trying to make a back-room deal, huh? Hah! I admire your gumption."
spring13,Caroline_y2,"It may be a little boring, but these festivals are a good chance to connect with our neighbors."
spring13,Alex_y2,I wonder what would happen to my arms and legs if I ate thirty eggs a day?
spring13,George_y2,"Evelyn made eggs and leeks for breakfast, so I'm in a good mood. "
spring13,Evelyn_y2,"  'Do you have hens on your farm?_Yes_Oh, good! I'm sure they lay the most delicious eggs... _No_Spring would be a great time to start raising chickens, don't you think?"
spring13,Clint_y2,Oh no... ... It's mostly salad this year... 
spring13,Penny_y2,It would be good for him to feel like he's a contender. Hopefully Vincent will be able to find an egg this year... 
spring13,Pam_y2,"Hey... If you're gonna feed me eggs, I'm gonna need some hot sauce, kid!"
spring13,Emily_y2,This year I sewed little pants and hats for some of the eggs. They look adorable! 
spring13,Haley_y2,Oh! I still need to get my photo taken at the bunny stand. Does my hair look okay?
spring13,Jodi_y2,Kent always seems a little antsy during big gatherings like this...
spring13,Marlon_y2,Have you ever hunted for slime eggs? Now there's a true challenge...
spring13,Leah_y2,Hmm... The punch isn't as good as last year. It's missing something!
spring13,Shane_y2,Some of these eggs were laid just this morning. See? They're still warm!
spring13,Marnie_y2,"That means happier hens and better eggs...  Hens lay the eggs, but roosters play an important role, too... they protect the hens and prevent them from fighting with each other!"
spring13,Elliott_y2,Be careful you don't accidentally take a raven's egg. They'll hold a grudge against you for the rest of their days!
spring13,Gus_y2,"Shh... don't tell anyone, but I tried something different this year... Duck eggs in the custard! "
spring13,Harvey_y2,"Eggs are fine, but I'd advise against eating thirty per day!"
spring13,Jas_y2,I'm going to try my best to win this year!
spring13,Vincent_y2,I want to live inside a big egg!
spring13,Willy_y2,"Aye... on rainy days, you'll find catfish in these waters. They're a challenging catch, but well worth the effort!"

spring24,Abigail,Mom makes me do it.  I really hate dancing in front of everyone... It's so embarrassing.
spring24,Robin,Ahh... The air smells so sweet with all these flowers. 
spring24,Demetrius,"Hey... You should know about this stuff, farmer. These springtime dances can be traced back to ancient fertility rituals."
spring24,Maru,"I like dancing, but this one is a little stilted. The old timers really love it, though."
spring24,Sebastian,Ugh...
spring24,Linus,"Spring is almost over... what a shame. Oh, hello there. It's nice of you to talk to me."
spring24,Pierre,Don't touch anything. What! How'd you get back here? 
spring24,Caroline,I wish Pierre would spend this time with the family... 
spring24,Alex,I'm just enjoying the scenery... hehe.
spring24,George,It's too bright out here! Flowers? I can hardly see them.
spring24,Evelyn,I've been working on these floral arrangements for a week. Do you like them?
spring24,Lewis,"If you'd like to dance with the other young people, you'll need to find a partner."
spring24,Clint,I wonder if Emily would dance with me?
spring24,Penny,... I'm nervous. 
spring24,Pam,"Now this is the life... Huh, kid? Sweet wine, a babbling brook, warm air... Did I mention wine?"
spring24,Emily,"Whoo... I'm stuffed. Hey, have you tried the red jelly yet?"
spring24,Haley,I've been flower queen for the past 5 years and I'm not ready to step off the throne just yet! I'm practicing my dance moves... It needs to be perfect.
spring24,Jodi,"Are you going to be dancing today, @? "
spring24,Kent," Happy thoughts, Kent. Happy Thoughts. This open field... it makes me nervous."
spring24,Marlon,Marnie looks lovely today...
spring24,Sam,You know what? I admit it... I really like flowers!
spring24,Leah,Hi @. Glad to see you here. 
spring24,Shane," ...ow.  Ah, this green stuff is spicy!  Mmm... excellent sauce. "
spring24,Marnie,... Love is in the air... And I'm still single. 
spring24,Elliott,I wore my best shirt for the dance... This sort of thing doesn't happen very often!
spring24,Gus,Frog season is really starting to pick up.
spring24,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
spring24,Wizard,You shouldn't be up here.
spring24,Harvey,I'm working up the courage to ask someone to dance with me. 1
spring24,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
spring24,Jas,"Some day, I'm going to be the flower queen!"
spring24,Vincent,That's not fair... Why can't I be the flower queen?
spring24,Willy,I should've brought my fishing pole.
spring24,Leo,"I wonder if I'll ever have to get up there and dance...  The flowers here are nice, but they aren't as colorful as back home! "

summer11,Governor,I must speak to the missus about purchasing a vacation home here. What a lovely occasion... It's always a joy to visit Stardew Valley.
summer11,Abigail_spouse,Don't let me stop you from having fun today. I just feel like watching the sea by myself.
summer11,Leah_spouse,"It's nice to see everyone once in a while, but mostly I want to get back to the farm."
summer11,Maru_spouse,"Harvey keeps trying to talk to me, but all I want is a piece of this roast."
summer11,Penny_spouse,I'm just humoring some old friends. What I really want is a bowl of that soup.
summer11,Haley_spouse,"Phew... I'm afraid to move, or else I might start to sweat."
summer11,Sebastian_spouse,I'm doing my best to stay in a good mood...
summer11,Sam_spouse,I guess it wouldn't be very nice to put something nasty in the soup...
summer11,Alex_spouse,"Hey, I'll take any excuse to come hang out at the beach. This weather is amazing!"
summer11,Harvey_spouse,Oh dear... I've got sand in my socks... 
summer11,Elliott_spouse,The old cabin seems to be holding up well. Every time I return I half expect the thing to be rotted...
summer11,Abigail,It's tiring to socialize with everyone... I'd rather watch the sea.
summer11,Emily,'s unresponsive.
summer11,Robin,"Ow... you stepped on my foot, dear."
summer11,Demetrius,"This is tiring, honey. Are you ready to visit the buffet soon? "
summer11,Maru,Whatever Linus is roasting smells awfully good... 
summer11,Sebastian,Ever wondered why Sam leads the town in community service hours?  One year Sam put a pound of anchovies in the potluck soup.
summer11,Linus,"A slow, continuous rotation is key to achieving the perfect roast."
summer11,Pierre,Now if only the Mayor would stop shmoozing with him all afternoon. I wonder if he likes aged whiskey? Hmm... maybe if I get on the governor's good side he'll give my business a tax break...
summer11,Caroline,I put fresh vegetables from my garden into the communal soup pot.
summer11,Alex,"Perfect weather for a beach party, huh?"
summer11,George,Can't I have a little peace and quiet to enjoy the ocean? That music! It's too loud.
summer11,Evelyn,Ahh... The smell of the ocean takes me back many years. Long before you were born.
summer11,Lewis,If you brought something for the potluck make sure and add it to the soup cauldron. Look sharp! The governor's here for his annual visit.
summer11,Clint,"I'm full, but what else is there to do besides eat?"
summer11,Penny,Mayor Lewis hopes it will get the governor on our good side. That's why he's so neurotic about the way the soup tastes. We do this festival every year to give the governor a taste of everything the valley has to offer.
summer11,Pam,"Heh... free buffet. One of the perks of living here. Enjoy it, kid!"
summer11,Haley,"I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty."
summer11,Jodi,I hope the soup is good this year.
summer11,Kent,"Hey, good to see you."
summer11,Marlon,I'll be back here by the trees... the air is a lot cooler.
summer11,Sam,Why should I care about some random old guy? Governor? Who cares...
summer11,Leah,How's the farming coming along? It must be a busy season for you.
summer11,Shane,Wow... you don't get hot pepper chutney like this in the big city...
summer11,Marnie,"If you brought something for the soup, climb the stairs on the other side and throw it in."
summer11,Elliott,"I forgot that today was the Luau.  I woke up late, stepped out of the door and found myself in the middle of all this hubbub!"
summer11,Gus,These blasted sand-flies keep landing on the food!
summer11,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
summer11,Wizard,They become upset when you litter into the ocean. The merpeople are curious about your festivities.
summer11,Harvey,I wonder if Maru could use some sunscreen on her shoulders? Good thing I came with sunscreen.
summer11,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
summer11,Jas,Vincent isn't a good dancer.
summer11,Vincent,I'm bored...
summer11,Willy,"To tell you the truth, I'd rather be fishing right now. Hi there, @. Taking a breather?"
summer11,Leo,Shhh... I'm learning the secrets of the perfect roast.

summer28,Leah_spouse,Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. I'll come meet up with you when we launch the candle-boat.
summer28,Abigail,Such a rare and exciting thing... 
summer28,Robin,"Hey, did you see that candle-boat? I crafted it myself.  ... It's past my bed-time. "
summer28,Demetrius,It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious. The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south.
summer28,Maru,"It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner."
summer28,Sebastian,"Just trying to scare you...  I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark."
summer28,Pierre,Psst... Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds!
summer28,Caroline,"These candles are romantic, aren't they?"
summer28,Linus,I'll just sneak up when the jellies arrive... I don't want to bother anyone.
summer28,Alex,I can't believe summer's over... I feel like it just started. 
summer28,George,"What, why are you looking at me like that? You think I'm too old to enjoy something like this?"
summer28,Evelyn,"But that was long ago... I'm a lot less energetic now. I remember seeing the jellies once, as a little girl. Oh, how I jumped with joy when they arrived!"
summer28,Lewis,"Once we launch the candle-boat they'll come up to the docks and say hello. Good evening, @. The Moonlight Jellies are close... I already saw one glowing in the distance."
summer28,Clint,I wore my special shoes tonight... No one noticed. 
summer28,Emily,"Eerie, isn't it? Look out there, at the endless sea. Deep underwater, all kinds of life forms are moving around in the dark."
summer28,Penny,Life is so easy for a jellyfish... just letting the waves carry you onward forever.
summer28,Pam,"Don't tell Gus, but I'm a little disappointed there's no buffet tonight."
summer28,Haley,I should've brought my camera! I always forget. 
summer28,Jodi,Oh... It's gone.  There! I just saw something glowing!
summer28,Kent,"Good evening, @. Hope you can find some time to relax before the harvest season."
summer28,Sam,Maybe I shouldn't push Sebastian in the water after all...  I wonder if they're poisonous?
summer28,Leah,Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. 
summer28,Shane,"The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back again a year from now... nature is amazing."
summer28,Marnie,That's a heavy load of people for an ancient wooden dock! I'll stay over here near the beach.
summer28,Elliott,"What a shame... we have no respect for nature anymore. If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct. It's already in the process of happening."
summer28,Gus,"I would never try it, of course!  'Moonlight Jellies'... I wonder how they taste? "
summer28,Dwarf,Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it. You say it's raining up above? 
summer28,Wizard,"I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form. Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance. How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden."
summer28,Harvey,"Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!"
summer28,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
summer28,Jas,I hope there are babies this year!
summer28,Vincent,I wanna see the rare green jelly!
summer28,Willy,Most night-fish would be scared of the light... these are strange ones.
summer28,Leo,"The moonlight jellies are my old friends... they come to the island every year, too."

winter25,Abigail_spouse,I wonder if I could lick one of those canes...
winter25,Leah_spouse,I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm. 
winter25,Maru_spouse,"Hey, @. I'm ready to head home whenever you are."
winter25,Penny_spouse,I'm thankful to have met you... 
winter25,Haley_spouse,"Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight? "
winter25,Sebastian_spouse,"Hey, @. As you can see, I'm fulfilling my family obligations..."
winter25,Sam_spouse,... I'm here for the gifts and the cookies. 
winter25,Alex_spouse,What am I thankful for? I'll show you when we get back home... 
winter25,Harvey_spouse,I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air... 
winter25,Elliott_spouse,"You don't need to get me anything, you've already given me the greatest gift of all... "
winter25,Abigail,"Nothing like a piping hot feast on a cold winter's day, huh? "
winter25,Robin,"Hiya, @. You're welcome to join our family table if you need company. "
winter25,Demetrius,I'll probably get another tool set this year... 
winter25,Maru,"Hi, @. "
winter25,Shane,"I've met some people who believe in spirits, and magic... but me? I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by science."
winter25,Sebastian,Spending time with family is tiring sometimes.
winter25,Pierre,"Boy, holidays are good for business. I wonder if I could invent some new ones... My sales figures have been phenomenal lately... thanks to the Feast of the Winter Star! "
winter25,Caroline,Ooohh... I've had too much nog. 
winter25,Linus,I'd join in... but I don't think I'm welcome. 
winter25,Alex,"Oh, hello. "
winter25,George,A feast for some stupid star? Humbug!
winter25,Evelyn,"Oh, my! Aren't you cold, dear? It's freezing!"
winter25,Lewis,Today is a time to be thankful for this year's good fortune. Forget your worries for a day and relax!
winter25,Clint,"... All these happy families. But for me, just another lonely year."
winter25,Emily,  '@! What are you hoping to find under the spirit tree?_A new watering can._All work and no play? That's not very fun. _A jug of spiced mead._Ooo... that sounds nice. Make sure to give me a taste. _A pair of stylish boots._I see. That would be a great gift!'
winter25,Penny,What a beautiful tree. 
winter25,Pam,Hmmph... I'm still upset I didn't win the ice fishing competition. 
winter25,Haley,I hope there's a new camera for me under the spirit tree!
winter25,Jodi,It's not a good time of year for a diet... 
winter25,Kent,"Good afternoon, @. Happy Feasting."
winter25,Sam,"I'm thankful for my guitar and my skateboard. Oh, and my family I guess."
winter25,Leah,I think he had too much cinnamon nog. Gus was just telling me about his artisan candy canes.  
winter25,Marnie,Welcome to the Feast of the Winter Star! 
winter25,Elliott,"Why, hello @. It's chilly, isn't it?"
winter25,Gus,"Hey, you look like you're falling asleep. Are you okay?  Of course, peppermint candy canes are the standard, and I always make a healthy batch of those as well. Oh, you want to know the secret to my deluxe double-canes? Okay, but you've got to promise absolute secrecy.  It's a drop of vanilla in the white candy to complement the cherry flavor.  I usually use Fern Island Ringfruit for my premier canes, you know. You can't beat that bright red coloring... And it's all natural! It's a fine art, making candy canes. You've really got to search far and wide for the best ingredients. They aren't easy to come by these days! "
winter25,Willy,"  'Do you want to hear the Legend of the Winter Star?_Yes_In the night sky of winter, there is a bright star only visible from this valley. No one knows why this is... but in times of old people would come from far and wide to see it.*They believed that anyone who laid eyes on the Winter Star would be blessed with good fortune. Some even claim that the mysterious fruit known as =Stardrop is connected to the Winter Star in some way._No thanks_Suit yourself.'"
winter25,Wizard,"Ah, the mysterious Winter Star. One of the reasons I chose this valley as the location for my... research."
winter25,Harvey,I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!
winter25,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
winter25,Jas,Ohh! Presents! 
winter25,Vincent,Can we open presents now?!
winter25,Marlon,"Hey, good afternoon."
winter25,Leo,"We'll have our own little feast... mashed winter root and spice berry fish!  Linus feels uncomfortable about joining in, so I'm going to keep him company."

winter8,Haley_spouse,Brr... my hands are freezing from making this snowman. 
winter8,Sebastian_spouse,"Don't worry about me, I never get cold..."
winter8,Sam_spouse,Aren't you cold? Are you sure you don't want my jacket?
winter8,Alex_spouse,I'll be rooting for you in the fishing competition.
winter8,Harvey_spouse,I'm dreaming of our warm fire back home... 
winter8,Elliott_spouse,"I know you'll beat me in the fishing competition, but I don't mind. I'm just here for the fun of it. "
winter8,Abigail,What do you think of my snow-goon?
winter8,Robin,"I'm sorry, but carving ice parapets requires my undivided attention!"
winter8,Demetrius,You know what? I probably should've worn a jacket.
winter8,Maru,I'm not very creative when it comes to snowmen. 
winter8,Sebastian,"Cold? Nah, I never get cold."
winter8,Pierre,This snow is so cold I can't feel my fingers anymore... 
winter8,Shane,"If it was up to me, I'd probably have a pizza festival at the saloon, instead..."
winter8,Caroline,"How's winter coming along for you, @? "
winter8,Linus,"An Igloo makes a nice home, but it's easier to just stay in my tent year-round. That was many years ago.  Igloo-building's an art I picked up from the tundra dwellers who live beyond the frozen sea."
winter8,Alex,"Snowmen are okay, I guess. But mostly I'm looking forward to the spring."
winter8,George,Hmmph... Wife dragged me out into the cold for this?
winter8,Evelyn,"He was a gentleman back then, and came over to see if I was okay.  Did I ever tell you how George and I first met? He actually pelted me with a snowball in this very festival."
winter8,Lewis,Just let me know when you're ready to compete. The highlight of today's festival is the ice fishing competition. We set up this 'frozen lake' and stocked it full of fish. Welcome to the Festival of Ice!
winter8,Clint,Emily started helping me without any provocation... does that mean something?  
winter8,Emily,"Wow, this snowman needs a makeover. Who made this? "
winter8,Penny,"  'Hmm... What kind of snowman should we make?_A classic one. Carrot nose, top-hat, scarf._I guess maybe it's best to stick with the classics, huh? _Something funky. Icicle antennas, pine cone eyes._Okay! That sounds like fun. _Snowmen are boring. Think outside of the box!_Um, okay... I think I might stick with something more conventional.'"
winter8,Pam,"Willy is gonna be pretty hard to beat, though... He does this kinda stuff day and night.  I plan on winning the ice fishing competition!"
winter8,Haley,I guess Winter isn't all bad... playing in the snow can be fun!
winter8,Jodi,"The forest looks beautiful in the winter, doesn't it?"
winter8,Kent,I like winter. It's peaceful.
winter8,Sam,"Oh, not me. I don't know how to fish. Hey, @. Are you gonna enter the ice fishing competition?"
winter8,Leah,"But I guess that might make the art even better. Oh, ice. A beautiful material to sculpt in, but so impermanent."
winter8,Marnie,"I feel bad for all the poor, cold animals out there. "
winter8,Elliott,"It's rare that Willy ever loses, though. I'm entering the ice fishing competition today. Why not?"
winter8,Gus,Just wait until the Feast of the Winter Star. You'll be stuffed for days. Sorry there's no food.
winter8,Willy,"  'Hey, @. Ready for some ice fishing?_Yes. I'll do my best!_That's the spirit! _Yes, and I'm going to beat you!_We'll see. _To be honest, no. I'm bad at fishing._Well, then think of it as good practice! '"
winter8,Wizard,Sneaking off to visit my weird tower? You're odd for a mundane.
winter8,Harvey,"Oh, and enjoy the festival!  Extreme temperatures can put your body under a lot of stress, so make sure to bundle up!"
winter8,Sandy,"I kind of miss the rain, actually...  I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? "
winter8,Jas,I wanna give him a carrot nose! 
winter8,Vincent,I saw a big fish down there!
winter8,Marlon,"Hey, good afternoon."
winter8,Leo,You could make an igloo twice as warm if you stuffed feathers in the walls!
