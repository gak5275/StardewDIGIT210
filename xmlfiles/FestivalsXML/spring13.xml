<p><context>Abigail_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Abigail">'Do you think I'm too old to do the egg hunt?_Yes_Hmmph... you sound like my Mom! Yeah, I guess so. If I'm still having fun, why stop?'</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Evelyn_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Evelyn">'Do you have hens on your farm?_Yes_Oh, good! I'm sure they lay the most delicious eggs... Spring would be a great time to start raising chickens, don't you think?</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Clint_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Clint">Oh no... *gulp*... It's mostly salad this year...</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Shane_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">Some of these eggs were laid just this morning. See? They're still warm!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Marnie_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Marnie">Hens lay the eggs, but roosters play an important role, too... they protect the hens and prevent them from fighting with each other! That means happier hens and better eggs...</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Elliott_y2:</context> <dialogue who="Elliott">Be careful you don't accidentally take a raven's egg. They'll hold a grudge against you for the rest of their days!</dialogue> </p>
