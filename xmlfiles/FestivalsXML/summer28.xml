<p><context>Leah_spouse:</context> <dialogue who="Leah">Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. I'll come meet up with you when we launch the candle-boat.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Abigail:</context> <dialogue who="Abigail">Such a rare and exciting thing... </dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Robin:</context> <dialogue who="Robin">*yawn*... It's past my bed-time. Hey, did you see that candle-boat? I crafted it myself.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Demetrius:</context> <dialogue who="Demetrius">The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south. It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Maru:</context> <dialogue who="Maru">It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sebastian:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark. Just trying to scare you...</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Pierre:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">Psst... Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Caroline:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">These candles are romantic, aren't they?</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Linus:</context> <dialogue who="Linus">I'll just sneak up when the jellies arrive... I don't want to bother anyone.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Alex:</context> <dialogue who="Alex">I can't believe summer's over... I feel like it just started.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>George:</context> <dialogue who="George">What, why are you looking at me like that? You think I'm too old to enjoy something like this?</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Evelyn:</context> <dialogue who="Evelyn">I remember seeing the jellies once, as a little girl. Oh, how I jumped with joy when they arrived! But that was long ago... I'm a lot less energetic now.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Lewis:</context> <dialogue who="Lewis">Good evening, @. The Moonlight Jellies are close... I already saw one glowing in the distance. Once we launch the candle-boat they'll come up to the docks and say hello.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Clint:</context> <dialogue who="Clint">I wore my special shoes tonight... No one noticed.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Emily:</context> <dialogue who="Emily">Look out there, at the endless sea. Deep underwater, all kinds of life forms are moving around in the dark. Eerie, isn't it?</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Penny:</context> <dialogue who="Penny">Life is so easy for a jellyfish... just letting the waves carry you onward forever.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Pam:</context> <dialogue who="Pam">Don't tell Gus, but I'm a little disappointed there's no buffet tonight.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Haley:</context> <dialogue who="Haley">I should've brought my camera! I always forget.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Jodi:</context> <dialogue who="Jodi">There! I just saw something glowing! Oh... It's gone.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Kent:</context> <dialogue who="Kent">Good evening, @. Hope you can find some time to relax before the harvest season.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sam:</context> <dialogue who="Sam">I wonder if they're poisonous? Maybe I shouldn't push Sebastian in the water after all...</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Leah:</context> <dialogue who="Leah">Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. </dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Shane:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back again a year from now... nature is amazing.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Marnie:</context> <dialogue who="Marnie">That's a heavy load of people for an ancient wooden dock! I'll stay over here near the beach.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Elliott:</context> <dialogue who="Elliott">If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct. It's already in the process of happening. What a shame... we have no respect for nature anymore.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Gus:</context> <dialogue who="Gus">'Moonlight Jellies'... I wonder how they taste? I would never try it, of course!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Dwarf:</context> <dialogue who="Dwarf">You say it's raining up above? *gasp* Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wizard:</context> <dialogue who="Wizard">How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden. Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance. I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Harvey:</context> <dialogue who="Harvey">Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sandy:</context> <dialogue who="Sandy">I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here? I kind of miss the rain, actually...</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Jas:</context> <dialogue who="Jas">I hope there are babies this year!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Vincent:</context> <dialogue who="Vincent">I wanna see the rare green jelly!</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Willy:</context> <dialogue who="Willy">Most night-fish would be scared of the light... these are strange ones.</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Leo:</context> <dialogue who="Leo">The moonlight jellies are my old friends... they come to the island every year, too.</dialogue> </p>
