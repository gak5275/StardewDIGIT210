<p><context>Resort_Leaving_2:</context> <dialogue who="Elliott">"Hopefully a crab hasn't snuck onto my clothes again. Imagine crawling out of a pocket and finding yourself on a beach hundreds of miles from home! Hmmm... Perhaps this could make for an interesting novel..."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Thu8:</context> <dialogue who="Elliott">"It's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend. It feels good to have a close friend like you."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu:</context> <dialogue who="Elliott">"Hello, @. Are you well?"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context><event>event_idea3:</event></context> <dialogue who="Elliott">"I would've never guessed! I suppose even those of the 'earthiest' profession sometimes have their heads in the stars. I'll remember that."</dialogue> </p>
