<p><context>Wed:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm? If not, we might be able to help you out. We carry a variety of useful items."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"Hmmm... I wonder if I can get Pierre to cook dinner tonight. Hmmm... what am I going to make for dinner tonight? Maybe I'll just get take-out from the Saloon."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"It's a fine-looking day. On days like this I like to help Evelyn with the public gardens. She's strong for her age, but I think she appreciates all the help she can get."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"Is it just me, or does Abigail have an unhealthy interest in doom and gloom? Maybe I'm just too old to understand."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>summer_Sat_inlaw_Abigail:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"How's Abigail's health? She's always been such a pale girl. Hopefully the farm lifestyle puts a little color in her cheeks."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>winter_Fri:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"Even though it's cold, I still check on the public garden beds every now and then. I just want to make sure they aren't damaged too much before spring returns."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Sat:</context> <dialogue who="Caroline">"Don't you think Abby would look better with her natural hair color? She used to have light chestnut-colored hair."</dialogue> </p>
