<p><context>cc_Complete:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"This is a dream-come-true! You can't begin to imagine how much stress JojaMart was causing me. For a small town like this, one store is enough! There's too much social pressure for me to overcharge, anyway."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>joja_Begin:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"This is a sad day for Pelican Town... The stronger Joja becomes, the closer I move toward bankruptcy. I might have to sell the shop soon..."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Tue:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"Sometimes I get new items in stock, so make sure to stop by every so often. It's a lot of work to run a shop."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue6:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"You know, I used to be a pretty good boxer back in the day... my right hook was the stuff of legend!"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Sun:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"*sigh*... I've got those behind-the-counter blues... I wish I could go for a walk, but I can't leave the store unattended. I've heard the flowers are in bloom and the air smells great..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed6:</context> <dialogue who="Pierre">"*sigh*... No matter how well the business does, it's never enough to satisfy my desire for success. What's wrong with me? Maybe I'm just bored with domestic life. Some day I'm going to open a new shop in the city and make a killing. Unfortunately, business is so slow I can hardly save any money..."</dialogue> </p>
