<p><context>Introduction:</context> <dialogue who="Lewis">"So, how was your first night in the old cottage? Your grandpa used to complain about the rickety old bed. But I think, deep down, he actually loved that house."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort:</context> <dialogue who="Lewis">"I'm impressed, @. You've really fixed up the place!"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>joja_Begin:</context> <dialogue who="Lewis">"So, the old Community Center is gone... I guess times change, and good things come and go... Yet I can't help but feel a sense of loss. I just hope this doesn't mar my record as Mayor."</dialogue> </p>
