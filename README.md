# StardewDIGIT210
Repository for our Stardew Valley analysis project for DIGIT 210

Stardew Valley has a few overarching themes:
* Appreciation of nature
* Connection with local community
* Escaping the rush of "modern life" (as the game puts it)

Questions we would like to answer by analyzing the game's text:
* To what extent are these themes represented in the game's dialogue?
* Which characters embody these themes the most? Which ones embody them the least?
* Are there any other themes consistently present throughout the dialogue?

How we will analyze the text of Stardew Valley:
* Look at the word usage of each character and identify recurring themes
* Create a network of connections and relationships between the characters
* Identify which locations in the game certain characters appear together
