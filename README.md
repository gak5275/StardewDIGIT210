# StardewDIGIT210: A Stardew Valley Analysis Project

Welcome to the StardewDIGIT210 repository! This project aims to analyze the popular game Stardew Valley, specifically focusing on its overarching themes and the representation of these themes in the game's dialogue.

## Main Themes

Stardew Valley is known for its emphasis on the following themes:

1. Appreciation of nature
2. Connection with the local community
3. Escaping the rush of "modern life" (as the game puts it)

## Research Questions

We aim to answer the following questions through our analysis of the game's text:

1. To what extent are the main themes represented in the game's dialogue?
2. Which characters embody these themes the most? Which ones embody them the least?
3. Are there any other themes consistently present throughout the dialogue?

## Methodology

To analyze the text of Stardew Valley, we will:

1. Examine the word usage of each character and identify recurring themes.
2. Create a network of connections and relationships between the characters.
3. Identify which locations in the game certain characters appear together.

By following this methodology, we hope to gain valuable insights into the thematic content of the game and the representation of its characters.
