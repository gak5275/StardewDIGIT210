"A stranger?... Hello.#$e#Don't mind me. I just live out here alone." 
"What do you have there? Looks like it would make good bait.$h" 
"My old friend, the glimmering boulder, has moved on. It may not seem like an important event, but to me it's a big change.#$b#I'm happy for the old rock to see more of the world, though.$h" 
"Oh... me? I usually wouldn't, but... okay. It's nice of you to think about me.#$b#I'll head over there in a little while." 
"The crisp air of the wilderness is all I care to know.#$e#I live out here by choice." 
"...Have you come to ridicule me?#$e#I'm just minding my own business." 
"I don't know you well enough to trust you. Sorry." 
"...Hmm? Do you want something from me?" 
"Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s" 
"I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends." 
"It would be nice if the townspeople could accept me for who I am.$s#$b#I like living out here in the open air. That's what they don't understand." 
"You can learn to survive in the wild. I have.#$e#I think we all have a hidden urge to return to nature. It's just a little scary to make the leap." 
"I spend a lot of time thinking.#$e#If you can fully understand the reasons behind your thoughts, you'll have reached a new level of being." 
"I have to be wary of strangers. Most people don't like a 'wild man'." 
"The people here seem nice, but they avoid me.#$e#People are afraid of the unknown.$u" 
"You can learn a lot from trees.#$b#Spend time with them and they might tell you their secrets.#$e#Go in peace, young one." 
"I have everything I need to survive, and more. Nature plays a wonderful tune if you can only learn to listen.#$e#I also spend a lot of time reading. One of the reasons I stopped in the valley was for the great library." 
"#$1 linusVandal#Someone was throwing rocks at my tent last night... I just had to wait it out.$s$k#$e#I don't like to stay in one place for too long. There's just too much to experience in the world." 
"During all these years I've discovered a few secrets about life.#$e#You'll have to find out for yourself." 
"#$1 LinusHeron#I saw a heron wading gracefully through the morning mist. Such are the treasures of a quiet life.$k#$e#It's so easy to get caught up in the noise of modern life. Your best years will pass you by in a formless blur. That's why you'v got to learn to slow down. " 
"How have you been, my young friend?" 
"Ah... summer. The warm sun heats up the cans for me.#$b#Then at night I've got a warm meal to look forward to." 
"I have my own reasons for living alone like this.#$e#Some things are best left unsaid...#$e#I should do some foraging." 
"Whenever you catch a fish, take a moment to thank it for its sacrifice.#$b#Even if you don't believe in the spirit of the fish, it's a good mental exercise. We need to be aware of our effect on the environment." 
"You can find rainbow trout in streams right now." 
"This is an easier time of year for me. I don't have to worry about staying warm.#$e#Plus, the fruits of the wild are growing everywhere." 
"I've explored deep into the caves.#$e#They hold some hidden secrets.#$e#Just be cautious if you go in there." 
"#$1 LinusFall1#Some joker sprayed paint all over my home during the night... It took hours to scrub it off this morning.$k#$e#I need to start gathering lumber for the winter.#$e#Do you have enough lumber to keep your house warm?" 
"I don't have many responsibilities, so I spend my time thinking.#$e#You have to understand your thoughts before you can control them." 
"I don't like to stay in one place for too long." 
"There's nothing quite like a feast of wild mushrooms in the fall.$h" 
"It can get really cold if you live in a tent.$s" 
"Thanks for not shunning me, @. It takes a lot of wisdom to override your base instincts.#$e#I'm a human like everyone else. I just have a different lifestyle." 
"I'm sure you understand why I'm cautious of strangers.#$e#But let's put that in the past, okay? You and I are friends now, I think." 
"Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by.#$e#If you have any animals you should keep them inside." 
"The trees go to sleep during the winter. It makes it a bit lonely out here.#$e#But I wouldn't deny them their beauty sleep.$h" 
"Thanks for stopping by. I was actually feeling a little lonely this morning.#$e#So, have you discovered anything interesting in the mines?" 
"Sleeping on the ground is good for my back.#$e#It's best to look at the positive side of things.$h"
