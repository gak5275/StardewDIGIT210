"Er... hi. I'm Clint.#$e#I'm the town blacksmith. If you ever need to upgrade your tools, I'm your guy." 
"I'm gonna put on my special red trunks. They're supposed to be really eye-catching." 
"Well, that didn't turn out like I was imagining..." 
"Oh no... I forgot to clip my toenails.$s" 
"I thought working a furnace would have prepared me for this heat, but I'm sweating in places I didn't know I could.$s#$e#I hope no one noticed..." 
"Ow... my whole torso is burnt to a crisp.$s" 
"I'm hungry...$s" 
"*sigh*... We're all at the beach but I still feel so alone...$s" 
"Hmm... That's an interesting stone, like nothing I've ever seen before.#$b#I wouldn't know what to do with it, though. I deal in the mundane, not the magical..." 
"Somehow, the old town minecart system started working again. It's very convenient for getting to and from the mines.#$b#Don't get too cozy, though... if it can start up so suddenly, it could just as well shut down..." 
"Yep. I'm a blacksmith.#$e#My father was also a blacksmith.#$e#My grandfather was a blacksmith as well.$u#$q 9/9 Mon_old#I bet you can't guess what my great-grandfather was..." 
"And yes, my great-grandfather was also a blacksmith." 
"How'd you know?$u" 
"Hahahaha. Good one.$h" 
"Wow. That was rude. I was just being funny and you took it to a whole new level." 
"Be glad you're a farmer, @. It's nicer to work outdoors than by a hot furnace all day.#$e#I'm only a blacksmith because my father pushed me into it." 
"If you want me to upgrade your tools you'll have to give me the correct ore.#$e#And you'll have to pay me a fee, of course." 
"Hey. What do you need?" 
"Oh, hi @. Sorry If I look a little messy. I've been working at the furnace all morning.$h#$e#So, did you need anything, or do you just want to visit?" 
"Business has been slow lately.#$e#You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash." 
"The weather doesn't really matter to me. I typically stay near my shop year-round.#$e#Depressing, huh?" 
"Sometimes I wonder how I ended up in this town.$u" 
"Damn it, I'm too old to do anything exciting anymore. All I have to look forward to is years and years of sweaty, hot furnace-work." 
"Don't you have work to do?" 
"So how are your tools holding up?" 
"Okay... I'll keep that in mind." 
"That's the problem... I do act natural... but I never have any success.$s" 
"Be glad you're a farmer, @. It's nicer to work outdoors than by a hot furnace all day.#$e#I'm only a blacksmith because my father pushed me into it." 
"Oh, hi @! Sorry If I look a little messy. I've been working at the furnace all morning.$h#$e#So, did you need anything, or do you just want to visit?" 
"Business has been slow lately.#$e#You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash." 

"I complain about my job sometimes, but I do take pride in my work.#$b#These are some of my finest pieces. I hope you like them."
"One of my iridium-infused maces would make quick work of these things."
"Is there any more food?$s"
"Oh no... *gulp*... It's mostly salad this year...$s"
"I wonder if Emily would dance with me?"
"I'm full, but what else is there to do besides eat?"
"I wore my special shoes tonight... No one noticed.$s"
"*sigh*... All these happy families. But for me, just another lonely year."
"Emily started helping me without any provocation... does that mean something? *gulp*$4"

"Hey. Your tool is ready but you don't have any room in your inventory."
"Um, I'm still working on your {0}. It won't be ready today."
"...I found you unconscious in the mines. I think I blew my back out, dragging you all the way up here.#$b#Be a little more careful next time, okay?$s"
"Yes! This is exactly what I've been looking for! This is a fun gift. Thanks! *Sigh*... This makes me depressed. Thanks."
"Um, Hello...     ^Sorry, I'm not good at writing letters. I made one metal bar too many, and I thought you might need it.
"Well, I know a couple of recipes.^I thought I'd send you one... maybe it'll help you mine more ore or something.^Take care.
"I've got an unusual request. Could you keep this a secret?^ I want you to deliver an amethyst to Emily. It's her favorite stone. Tell her it's from me.
Sorry to bother you again, but I need another favor.^I got a new hammer and I want to try it on a variety of metals.^Could you smelt an iron bar and bring it to me? ^Thanks.
"Um, Hello...     ^Thanks for helping me clear out those monsters.^^I'm not scared at all! ...But it should make the mines safer for everyone else... right?^^Take this blueprint. (Hope it doesn't make me obsolete...)
"Um, Hello...     ^Thanks for helping me clear out more monsters.^^Maybe next time, I'll take care of them myself... if I have time!^^Take this item. I found it in the back room...
"Today would be a good day to explore the mines... Who knows, you might find some rare ores."

"Uh... Hi there. Good morning.#$b#I noticed that you've been breaking some rocks open and finding ore. That's good!\"
"If you want to get the most out of the ores you find, you'll need a furnace.\"
"Just so happens I had an extra set of blueprints lying around. Here, I want you to have them.\"
"The furnace allows you to smelt metal bars. The bars can be used for crafting, construction, and tool upgrades.\"
" When you've smelted a few copper bars, consider having me upgrade one of your tools. It can make your work a lot easier.#$b#Well, okay. I'm heading home. Take it easy.\"

"Oh no...\"
"M...Me?\"
"*gulp*... Okay, Emily. I'll do it.$4\"
"Aww? Cute? ...*sigh*...$7\"
"I couldn't do it! I don't wanna break out of my shell!$6\"
"...Oh. I... I guess I'm interrupting something here, aren't I?$7\"
"I understand. I'll leave now... Congrats, @.$7\"

"Hello, @... care to join me?\"
"Let me just go ahead and tell you what's on my mind.$u#$b#I have terrible luck with women, @...*sigh*$s#$b#I'm a nice guy if you get to know me, I swear!$u\"
"The girls all seem to like you, @...^You're a girl, @...\"
Got any tips?^What advice can you give me?
"Yes!\"
"Er.. I mean, I'll have the Big n' Cheesy. With extra sauce, please.$s#$b#...$u\"
"Er... *ahem* Th...Thanks, Emily. For... taking my order.#$b#Um, Emily? I was...*gulp*... I was wondering...$h\"
"... nevermind.$s\"
"*sigh*$s#$b#I'm doomed...$s\"

"I... I... Uh...\"
"I'm sorry!$s\"
"It's hard to remember my lines when her face is right in front of me like that...$s\"
"No! It's not like that... This is just something I have to do. It's very important to me.\"
"I've just got to try new 'Joja Bluu' cola.$5#$b#It's got three times the sorbitol for a thick, sweet blast. And it's cheaper than water!$5\"
"Have no fear, my dear. The world-class science team at Joja Headquarters have determined that 'Joja Bluu' does not cause a significant erosion of the stomach lining. So you can drink it whenever you like, as much as you like.$5#$b#The real question is... 'When will YOU turn bluu?'... *glug* *glug*... Ahh...$5\"

"@!$4#$b#...You caught me.$s\"
"I was planning to ask Emily on a date. I was at her doorstep and everything... but then I heard her coming and I dove into this bush.$s#$b#Now I'm waiting until she's done talking with Caroline so I can sneak back into my house.$s\"
"What did you just say? You'll never upgrade your tools again if I don't ask her out?$s\"
"You're a villain, @.#$b#*sigh* ...alright, I'll do it.$s\"
"I gotta remember that advice @ gave me in the saloon.\"
"Um... Emily?\"
"I was wondering if you'd go w... with... tomorrow, me... *gulp*$4\"
"I've got two tickets for the Grampleton Carnival tomorrow. W... Would you go with me? $4\"
"Really? Okay! I'll pick you up at five.$h\"
"Did you see that?! I've got a date tomorrow night!$h\"
"Oh man...I'm so nervous.$s\"
"Thanks for forcing me to do that, earlier. I'm scared, but also very pleased.$h\"

"It's an old family recipe. I baked it right in the smelting oven.#$b#Oh, um... I may have burnt the bottom a little, so... uh... you might have to peel off a layer of charred matter. But the rest is totally edible.\"

“Dear Emily, I know you only think of me as a friend. It's my fault. I'm too shy. I'll never have the courage to tell you the truth. That's why I'm writing this letter to myself that I'll certainly crumple up and toss in the corner.”
