"Hey, kid. I'd buy you a drink if I could afford it!" 
"Hey Gus! Gimme another round! *hic*$h" 
"*Sigh*... Hey, kid. You're too young to be moping around in a place like this." 
"*gulp* ... I've been looking forward to this beverage all afternoon. Heh heh." 
"Oi, Gus! Gimme another pint of your strongest!" 
"Hey, you! Don't be snoopin' around the trailer when I'm out. Got it?$u#$e#Sorry, but I gotta be cautious with strangers." 
"I was reading the newspaper this morning but then I got depressed. It's a rotten world, kid.#$e#Keep your head screwed on right and you'll make it through in one piece...#$b#That's what my Pappy always used to say. Heh heh heh.$h"

"You know, I've been thinking... I wish I had a hobby. Something to do other than hanging around at that saloon every night.#$e#You got any ideas?#$e#...Ehh. Maybe I'll play checkers against myself." 
"Each day's just the same as the last...$s#$b#If only I'd been born rich...$s"

"Havin' a local farm is good for our town." 
"Maybe if you do real well on your farm it'll boost the local economy.#$e#Then everyone will have a job and we'll all be happy, right?" 
"Oh, hi there, farmer.#$e#I don't often chit-chat with strangers." 
"I always seem to end up at the saloon at some point.#$e#It's too close to my house. It ain't healthy." 
"...Yeah?#$e#You're a fine lookin' young man. Why're you wastin' your time talkin' to an old girl like me?^You're a pretty gal. What're you wastin' your time talkin' to someone like me for?" 
"Don't mind that ol' dog next to the house.#$b#He might look at you cross, but he'll never get up from that box in a hunderd years.#$b#The old boy's name? It's Dusty." 
"Someone's been complainin' about my yard... sayin' it's a mess. Was it you?$u#$e#Hmmm..."

"Would you do me a kindness and clean up my house?#$e#Just kidding.$h" 
"Don't you have work to do?#$e#You should be thankful that you have a job rather than moping around town all the time." 
"I miss my old truck driving job. I used to go all around the valley, meetin' people, listenin' to the radio.#$e#Times sure do change." 
"You got any hogs on that farm?" 
"Do you want somethin' from me, kid? Best look somewhere else." 
"I just hope Penny has a good life ahead of her. If you ever have kids you'll know how I feel.#$e#...It's so dry in winter. My skin feels like old parchment." 
"Hey. You better be treatin' Penny right on that old farm of yours. She's the only one I got!" 
"Hey kid. What're you up to?#$e#I'm just passin' time, same as always." 
"It's awful cold. A visit to the saloon should warm me up, don't you think? Heh heh.#$e#Why don't you swing by the saloon later for a taste o' the Oh-Be-Joyful?" 
"Penny sure does like old books. I think she's a heck of a lot smarter than I ever was.#$e#I'm glad."
