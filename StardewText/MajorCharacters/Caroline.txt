"Hello! You must be @, the new farmer. I'm Caroline.#$e#My husband runs the general store here. And have you met my daughter, Abigail? She's the pale one with the purple hair." 
"Willy gave us each a piece of his fish jerky. I'm still chewing on it." 
"I'll sleep well tonight!$h" 
"The water is so warm here compared to the valley. It's really pleasant!" 
"I told Gus to surprise me, and he made an iced green tea with mango zest. How nice!$h" 
"Hi @. Are you here to relax, or to do work?" 
"I wish Abby wouldn't spend so much time in her room." 
"Hi, @. Are you enjoying the married life? I hope so!" 
"#$1 Caroline23#When we first moved to Pelican Town I would take secret walks to the Wizard's tower. Don't tell Pierre, he has jealousy issues.#$e#Abigail was born about a year after we moved to Pelican Town. I wonder if she'll ever experience life outside the valley?" 
"I've seen wild horesradish in the forest.#$e#Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food." 
"Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm?#$e#If not, we might be able to help you out.#$e#We carry a variety of useful items." 
"#$1 Caroline1#Hmmm... I wonder if I can get Pierre to cook dinner tonight.#$e#Hmmm... what am I going to make for dinner tonight?#$e#Maybe I'll just get take-out from the Saloon." 
"It's a fine-looking day.#$e#On days like this I like to help Evelyn with the public gardens.#$e#She's strong for her age, but I think she appreciates all the help she can get." 
"Is it just me, or does Abigail have an unhealthy interest in doom and gloom?#$e#Maybe I'm just too old to understand." 
"Dinner's been a lot quieter since Abigail moved out...#$e#No, not because she used to chew with her mouth open!$h" 
"Abby's always had a strange interest in the occult. I'm not sure where she gets it from..." 
"Abby's always had a strange interest in the occult. I'm not sure where she gets it from..." 
"#$1 Caroline12#When we first moved here, I took a while to settle down... I wasn't ready for the domestic life.#$e#Pierre's a bit traditional... but he's a good man. He's ambitious, but he always puts his family first." 
"Today I'm just going to relax and think positively.#$e#Do you ever take a day off?" 
"Stardew Valley is nice, but I wish I knew more people.#$e#I'm glad that we've become friends." 
"On wednesdays the shop is closed.#$e#Keep that in mind if you're going to need anything." 
"I've been seeing wild fruits in the forest lately.#$e#Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food." 
"Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm?#$e#If not, we might be able to help you out.#$e#We carry a variety of useful items." 
"Is it just me, or does Abigail look a little pale?#$e#Maybe I'm just worrying about her too much." 
"How's Abigail's health? She's always been such a pale girl. Hopefully the farm lifestyle puts a little color in her cheeks." 
"Today I'm just going to relax and think positively.#$e#Do you ever take a day off?" 
"Time seems to go by faster and faster the older you get...$s " 
"Fall is Abby's favorite season, so I'm hoping she'll come out of her room more often." 
"Abby was taking online classes here, but I don't think her heart was really in it...#$e#She's a free spirit, like I was before I met Pierre. She's probably having the time of her life on your farm." 
"I've seen edible mushrooms in the forest.#$e#Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food." 
"Is it just me, or does Abigail play too many video games?#$e#Maybe I'm a little old-fashioned." 
"You know, I used to want to be a farmer myself. Well, more like a rancher.#$e#I always loved movies about the wild west when I was a girl." 
"Winter is harsh, but you can dig up some roots if you're lucky.#$e#Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food." 
"Even though it's cold, I still check on the public garden beds every now and then.#$e#I just want to make sure they aren't damaged too much before spring returns." 
"Don't you think Abby would look better with her natural hair color?#$e#She used to have light chestnut-colored hair." 
"Are you excited for the new year?#$e#I predict that you'll be super-successful on your farm.$h" 

"Abby's always loved the egg hunt, ever since she was a tiny girl."
"It may be a little boring, but these festivals are a good chance to connect with our neighbors."
"I wish Pierre would spend this time with the family...$s"
"I put fresh vegetables from my garden into the communal soup pot."
"These candles are romantic, aren't they?"
"Pierre is very serious about his grange display. He's been setting aside the best-looking produce for weeks in preparation.#$e#Hey, best of luck to you if you enter!"
"I get scared very easily. I'll leave the haunted maze to the younger people."
"How's winter coming along for you, @?$h"
"Ooohh... I've had too much nog.$h"

"Oh, @... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your {2}s you sold us into my compost bin.$s#$b#Now the whole thing smells horrendous. Where did you find that thing again?"
"Oh, @... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your {2}s you sold us into my compost bin.$s#$b#But on the bright side, the worms are really loving it! They've never looked happier!"
"You're giving this... to me? I'm speechless. Oh, goodness! Are you sure? No, no, no... This is absolute junk. I'm offended. Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.//"
"Dear @,^Here's a vegetable from the little garden I keep out back. You probably have more veggies than you know what to do with, but oh well.
"Dear @,^nothing is more satisfying than cooking with fresh vegetables from your own garden! I've enclosed a recipe to help you out. Take care,
"Dear @,^^Thanks for stopping by my sunroom yesterday. I usually drink tea alone, but it was fun to share with you!^^I've enclosed instructions on how to prepare and grow your own tea. No pressure, but if you do end up growing some, make sure to bring me a cup!
"Hi @,^^Lewis told me that you've been shipping a lot of ingredients from the island! It's great to have access to new produce... it really opens a whole new world of culinary possibilities!^I'm including a gift for you... some blueprints you might find useful.
"My garden is happy today.$h#$e#...and our water bill will be lower this month."

"Pierre!\"
"Relaxed\"
"Hey, cut it out! We're letting you live here free of charge until you finish school. It seems like you don't appreciate that at all!$u\"
"...You're right. I'm sorry.$s\"
"Alright! That concludes our aerobics class!#$b#Are you breaking a sweat?$h\"
"Oh, joy\"

"So, what do you think?\"
"Thank you! I've worked very hard to make it this way...$h\"

"Sure, no problem...\"
"Delicious\"
"I love to come in here for a fresh cup of tea every day.#$b#It's my little ritual... #$b#Uh... let me try to explain...$h\"
"When I'm alone with relaxing tea..."
"My mind is empty and free to wander..."
"Who knows what might appear?"
"I hope that makes sense... #$b#Life can be pretty hectic, so having a hobby like this is nice.\"
"Feel free to come here and relax any time you want, okay?\"
