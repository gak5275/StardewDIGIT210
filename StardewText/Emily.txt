"Ooh!... I can read it on your face. You're going to love it here in Pelican Town.#$b#If you're ever looking for something to do in the evening, stop by the saloon. That's where I work!" 
"Oh, I like this place! It's full of parrots!" 
"Ah... my lungs feel perfect." 
"Can you feel it? The ocean has a profound healing energy." 
"Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!" 
"It's nice to be on this side of the bar for once!$h" 
"If you open your heart to the sun, you can feel a loving energy inside of you.$h" 
"I'm very sorry... but I've already agreed to dance with someone else.$u" 
"@... You broke my heart... I just can't talk to you anymore.$s#$e#Please, let me try to heal...$s" 
"...$s" 
"B...But I thought we had a special bond... *sniff*$s" 
"Oh, that's beautiful... I have a friend who would love that! But she lives far from here..." 
"@... I'm ready to give you a second chance. I still have faith that there's a good person inside of you.$s" 
"Have I told you Haley and I are sisters? Strange, isn't it?" 
"I have a secret hobby, but I won't say any more.#$e#Maybe I'll show you some day.$h" 
"This world is full of spirits and magic... Some don't believe me, but I know it's true.#$e#I can see it in your eyes... you believe in the other world, like me." 
"I wish Haley would get a job or at least contribute to cooking and cleaning.$s#$e#I think she's hoping to marry someone rich.$u" 
"I have to say, now that Haley's gone I've had a much easier time keeping things in order." 
"There's good people in this town who just can't seem to find happiness. It makes me sad.$u#$e#Working in the saloon, I hear first-hand about everyone's problems.$u" 
"I work part-time at Gus' saloon. It pays the bills." 
"I'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring.$u#$e#I made these clothes from scratch, see?" 
"Oh, hi... It's nice of you to visit me like this.$h" 
"You know, @... I think the future looks bright for both of us." 
"I've heard rumors of rare and powerful magic rings, forged long ago by forgotten civilizations. I'm not sure if it's true or just a fairy tale." 
"You catch fish? I just hope you treat the poor things humanely.$s#$e#Every critter deserves our respect, even the slimy ones." 
"Have faith... every day you're taking one more step on the path of your destiny." 
"Hi, @.$u#$e#I always knew we'd become close like this..." 
"I hope you're farming in a sustainable way. The valley's ecosystem is fragile!#$e#How do I know? I have a strong gut-feeling!" 
"Sometimes the flowers speak to me... each one has a different story to tell!" 
"Ah, spring. The season of pastels. I actually prefer jewel tones, myself.#$b#Oh, excuse me! I was mumbling about fashion again, wasn't I?" 
"I like making my own clothes, but it's not easy to get cloth.#$e#And it's such a long trip to the city." 
"Do you ever think about the texture of fabric, @? Each texture has a distinct personality... feel my dress... see?" 
"Hi @!#$e#Do you raise sheep in your barn? You can turn their wool into beautiful bolts of cloth!#$e#You'll need a loom, though. You can make them yourself if you know the crafting recipe." 
"This house was left in our care by my parents. They've been traveling the world for the last two years.#$e#We have no idea when they'll be back.#$e#I enjoy living here, though. It's a beautiful area and the town is nice." 
"Thank you!" 
"Um... Okay. Sorry you didn't like it. I guess those three years of practice were a complete waste...$s" 
"Did you really think so? That's exactly the effect I was shooting for!$h#$b#I'm so glad you liked it." 
"Haley is a picky eater. It's so hard to cook for her." 
"Eating healthy is very important to me. I want to live a long and active life." 
"Haley and I get along much better now that she's moved out. I look forward to her visits!" 
"Hello there, @.#$e#I feel lazy today.$u" 
"I feel bad for Linus. People judge him, but he's just living a different lifestyle.$u#$e#I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others." 
"Hi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we?$h#$e#That's fine with me. You're a cool guy.^I'm glad.$h" 
"Hi, @! We've become decent friends, haven't we?$h#$e#This may sound weird, but I've always been certain this would happen." 
"It doesn't rain much in summer, does it?#$e#That just means more watering work for you, huh?#$e#Or do you enjoy the sunny weather?" 
"I consider the bees and butterflies to be my special friends!" 
"If I wasn't so busy I'd come help you on the farm!#$e#But Gus would be upset if I had another job...$s" 
"You know, I'm sure Gus would understand if I wanted to leave the Saloon someday.#$b#There's so much out there, I can't stay a barmaid forever.$u" 
"Don't overwork yourself or you might end up in Harvey's clinic!" 
"Hi @!" 
"It's around this time of year that my good friends visit the region... I mean the parrots!" 
"Well, fall is here. Time to plant some new crops, huh?" 
"It's good weather for a picnic, isn't it?" 
"If I didn't have to work I'd suggest we go on a nice picnic!" 
"Hello. Did you have a good summer?" 
"Hi @! I bet your farm did great this past summer, huh?#$e#You're an excellent farmer.$h" 
"My friend runs a shop in the desert. If you ever go there stop in and say hi for me.#$e#I think she sells some rare products." 
"Are you friends with Clint? He's a nice guy, if you get to know him.#$e#He gets lonely working in his shop all day. But he's so shy he has trouble making new friends." 
"I think Clint's mad at me. He never looks at me anymore...$u#$e#I always thought we were friends.$u" 
"Another beautiful fall day.#$e#It's a pity it'll soon be over." 
"Smell that clean air? It's lovely, isn't it?#$b#I just fear that the Joja Co.'s of the world will take this away from us.$u" 
"Keep your mind open and some interesting things might take root.#$e#Anyway, how is your day going?" 
"I don't have any huge plans for life. I prefer not to stress about the future." 
"Nothing like a sunny sunday to lift the spirits!" 
"There's so many invisible barriers holding us back. Why can't people learn to let go and celebrate freedom?#$e#Me? Well, you know what they say... 'You can't cage a wild Junimo'." 
"You're such a nice person, @! Thanks for being my friend.$h" 
"Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head!" 
"Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head! I wouldn't want you to get hurt!" 
"Oh, hello @!$h#$e#You must be getting very good at farming by now, huh?" 
"I bet you're an excellent farmer by now!" 
"I think my hair is frozen solid...$s" 
"Haley and I aren't made for such a big house. It's a hassle to keep it clean.#$e#Ah well. I really shouldn't be complaining.#$e#Your farmhouse seems nice and cozy.$h" 
"It must be so cold for the poor fish.$s#$e#I wonder if any fish hibernate? Maybe I should ask Demetrius." 
"If I wasn't so busy I'd help you dig around in that cave by the lake.#$e#I bet there are some powerful crystals inside there." 
"Do you know how to cook 'Bean Hotpot'?#$e#I like that dish quite a bit. It's hard to get fresh ingredients in the winter, huh?" 
"Hi!#$e#...Yes?" 
"My sister and I might fight sometimes, but I would really miss her if she left.#$e#I think she'll become a very nice young lady some day... Don't tell her I said that.$h#$e#So, is there anything you want to talk about?" 
"Say hi to my sister for me! And remind her to visit me tomorrow." 

"I wonder where the flying insects go when it rains? Don't they get hit by the raindrops?" 
"A day like this is a blessing from mother nature." 
"Good morning... I got this gift for you. Don't worry, I already purified it with sage incense. [428 440 444 338 207]" 
"I meant to let the parrot go free, but his wing never fully healed. He seems content, though. I give him lots of attention.#$e#He told me that he's happy here." 
"I never told you this... but when you first moved here I had a dream about you. I knew right then that our life-paths would intertwine.$4" 
"Every moment has a unique and precious beauty... do you notice? It can be easy to forget, sometimes." 
"This is my favorite spot for a morning meditation.#$e#I visualize the energy from this crystal garden flowing through my body." 
"I can hear the plants talking to each other... they're so happy after today's rain!" 
"How was your day, @? You look a little soggy." 
"My day was very peaceful. How was yours?" 
"Want some dessert? It's my special raw, gluten-free version, sweetened only with cactus syrup.[232 234 223 220]$h" 
"Does the sound of rain ever put you in a trance?" 
"Another beautiful day on  farm... I have faith that something good will happen today!$h" 
"Here, take this. It's for you. [428 440 444 338 207 395 749]" 
"Hey, someone must've gotten a good night of sleep... you look fresh this morning.$h" 
"My horoscope for the day isn't too good... but I'm going to make the best of it, as always. Let's get to work!" 
"Ughh... *gurgle*... I ate too many bran muffins for breakfast.$s" 
"Is that a new hole I see in your shirt? I can sew that up for you, no problem." 
"Welcome home, @. I hope you had a wonderful day." 
"Is it bed time already? My, the day just floated away from me again.$u" 
"Ah, that aroma! It can only be you.$h#$e#It's a good smell." 
"I swept the whole house, washed the windows, dusted, and cleaned the fridge. It was a very productive day!" 
"I love getting up early. There's a certain freshness to the air and the wildlife is much more active." 
"What's on the agenda today, dear?" 
"Oooh! Ooh! I saw another one!$h#$e#I'm counting squirrels." 
"A little sunlight is good for you. Just don't get crispy, okay?" 
"Good morning! I was wondering when you'd finally roll out of bed!$h#$e#It's okay, @... you deserve a good night of rest." 
"I hope we can raise 1 to be kind and considerate. That's more important than getting A's in school." 
"Is one child enough, or should we raise another?#$e#I guess we'll just see where fate leads us." 
"I lit a pale green candle and shook a sprig of baby-mint over 1. That should ward off any dangerous spirits." 
"A big house, two kids and a parrot... I have my hands full!" 
"Well, 2 certainly has your hair...$u" 
"Oh, I already fed the kids their organic quinoa puffs with goat milk. You just focus on the farm!" 
"This is so fun to live together! I always thought I'd be single my whole life." 
"It was our destiny to be together... I believe that with all my heart!" 
"Thanks for taking me into your home. I love this new life.$4" 
"Our vibrational energies are perfectly in tune. Can't you feel it?" 
"I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is beautiful! I can feel the pure blue energy radiating from it.$l" 
"I had another dream about us last night. We had climbed to the top of a crystal tree, looking down on the most lush and beautiful meadow. I keep having this dream.#$e#I don't know what it means, but I feel that it's a good omen." 
"I hope you'll still like me when I grow old and my hair turns to a dull, faded steel." 
"I feel uninspired today.$s" 
"I'm going to visit town today, and later on I'm going to help out at the saloon. Have a nice day." 
"My day went well... it's good to get out of the house now and then." 
"My friends, the plants, have come back to life. I feel content." 
"Happy new year, honey. Let's make this a special one.$4" 
"Hmm... I'm thinking maybe a salad of fresh foraged greens for dinner tonight?" 
"The energy in our bodies fluctuate just as the seasons do. Understanding your own unique rhythym is the first step to inner harmony." 
"May Yoba bless you on this lovely day.$7" 
"The year's already half-way over. Can you believe it?" 
"Our bodies are naturally in tune with the seasons. This light and color of fall compels us to prepare for the barren winter.#$e#To our distant ancestors, this feeling was encompassing and vital. For us, it only barely peeks through the noise of modern life." 
"On a day like this, I have a craving for cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom." 
"*sigh*... Why does there have to be war and hatred in the world?$s" 
"I can't help but think of all the poor, frozen squirrels out there right now.$s" 
"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @!$h" 
"I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing!$h" 
"Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it?#$e#Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today." 
"Whoops, my hair is frozen solid again.$s" 
"I'm going to spend some time with the parrot today. It breaks my heart that he'll never fly again.$u" 

"You know, I would've made a pretty good clown. I think I missed my calling."
"Do you like the jack-o-lanterns? I carved them myself."
"I've been up since dawn coloring eggs... it's always my favorite part of the season.$h"
"This year I sewed little pants and hats for some of the eggs. They look adorable!$h"
"Whoo... I'm stuffed. Hey, have you tried the red jelly yet?"
"Look out there, at the endless sea. Deep underwater, all kinds of life forms are moving around in the dark.#$b#Eerie, isn't it?"
"Wow, this snowman needs a makeover. Who made this?$s"
"$y '@! What are you hoping to find under the spirit tree?
	All work and no play? That's not very fun.
	Ooo... that sounds nice. Make sure to give me a taste.
	I see. That would be a great gift!'"

"Can you believe we're about to move in together? I've never lived with anyone but my family.#$e#It's... exciting."
"I always knew something important would happen between us... I just never thought it would be this!$h#$e#The parrot is excited too."

"This is a special moment...#$b#I've always known I would be standing here with you, someday. I've always felt it in my heart.#$b#Now, it's all come true.\"
"The world is a mysterious and special place...$l"

"I know you pride yourself on your work, but don't overdo it today. Okay, honey?$u"
"Certain spirits only appear in the rain. Maybe you've heard their cries?"
"By providing fresh, healthy produce to the community, we're doing a great service!"
"It's a very cozy house... I like it."
"You're doing great work, @. Keep it up."
"Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it?#$e#Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today."
"I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing!$h"

"Hi!\"
"Hey, honey... before you get to work today, do you have a moment?#$b#I've been working on something special for you... but I need a little help finishing it.\"
"It's a secret, so I can't tell you what it is... but could you bring me 200 pieces of fiber?\"
"That's all I need! Just bring the 200 fiber by when you have a chance... no rush!\"
"No peeking! You'll see the end result soon.\"

"Hi @! Good morning!\"
"You seem to be doing well... the farm looks great!$h\"
"So... you've been here a while, and I'm sure you've acquired some 'cloth' by now... right?\"
"Well, did you know that you can use cloth to tailor all kinds of clothes? All you need is access to a sewing machine...#$b#And I happen to have one at home! Feel free to swing by and use it any time.$h\"
"To start tailoring, you'll need a piece of cloth and a secondary item. Experiment and see what unique styles are out there!\"

"Good morning, @.$h\"
"I just remembered... I have a sewing machine at my old place!\"
"If you ever feel like making clothes, you should swing by and check it out.$h\"
I'm going to have a lot of fun seeing you in all kinds of different outfits!$h\"

"Welcome home, @. I hope you had a nice day.\"
"So... I finished that secret project I was working on.\"
"It's a brand new hand-made outfit for you!$h\"
"I've always loved sewing and making crafts... So I thought it'd be nice to make you something by hand. I had a lot of fun!#$b#I hope it fits right... and that the fiber isn't too itchy.#$b#There's boots, a hat, a shirt, and pants! It's a complete outfit.\"
"Now, when you wear those clothes, you'll think of me... and you'll know I'm here waiting for you to come home safe... okay?$l\"
"Time for bed.\"

"You're being childish, Haley. I do the vast majority of work in this house, and you know it.$u\"
"He has a name, you know.$u^She has a name, you know.$u\"
"*sigh*... I'm really sorry to involve you in this, @. Haley is complaining because I asked her to clean under the cushions.$u\"
"Thanks, @. That was a great solution.$h\"
"*sigh*... I guess I'll just do it, then...$s\"

"Come in, @! I want to show you something.$h\"
"It's my secret hobby... I've been practicing for months.#$b#Now, sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be carried away to a better place... okay?\"
So... *gasp*... what did you think?
"Phew... that was quite a workout...$u\"
"I haven't been this sweaty since I ordered the pepper platter at Abigail's graduation fiesta!$h\"

"Great... everyone has their stone.#$b#Now, close your eyes, and take slow, deep breaths. Focus on your lungs.\"

"Now, open your heart to the vibrational frequency of your stone. Do you feel anything?\"

"Welcome to clothing therapy!\"
