"I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back." #!String
"Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back." #!String
"The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!" #!String
"Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island?#$e#Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways.$h" #!String
"My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while.#$e#I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy." #!String
