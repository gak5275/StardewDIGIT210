"Oh! Aren't you the one who just moved in?#$b#I'm Maru. I've been looking forward to meeting you!$h#$e#You know, with a small town like this, a new face can really alter the community dynamic. It's exciting!" 
"Willy mentioned that you helped fix the boat. Thanks for doing that!" 
"That was fun!" 
"I've been noticing a few different starfish species. My favorite are the big purple ones, but they're all very interesting!" 
"*gasp*... It's a solar eclipse!$3#$b#Oh... nevermind. It's just your body blocking the sun." 
"We're so far removed from civilization out here.#$b#Imagine the stars you could see at night.#$e#Who knows, maybe we'd even see a flying saucer or two!$h" 
"Mmmm... Why are tropical fruits so good?" 
"I wonder if Willy would let me bring my telescope here sometime...#The sky is so clear here, I bet I could spot Pelican Town out in the horizon.#Maybe I'd even see you running around  Farm!" 
"I'm flattered! But... No." 
"We have nothing to say to each other.$a" 
"Not good enough for you, huh?$a#$b#Fine...$s" 
"You've got some nerve, speaking to me!$a" 
"You've lost some respect with me, @... but I'm willing to forgive you.$s" 
"Whenever I'm struggling with a technical problem, I always take a walk.#$e#It's surprising how much a change of scenery can help." 
"Have you met my mother? She's the town's carpenter." 
"On Tuesdays and Thursdays I work at Harvey's clinic.#$b#He says he likes having me around in case his medical equipment goes haywire!$h#$e#Being a farmer must be pretty easy, huh?" 
"I plan on spending a lot of time with my telescope this summer." 
"Do you know my Dad, Demetrius? He's a scientist. I have a lot of fun helping him out in the laboratory." 
"Hey, sorry if I seem cranky... I'm a little sore from work yesterday.#$c .5# I had to carry ten boxes of medical files to the attic!#$e#I had to sort patient records for four hours straight! " 
"Hi!#$q 3/4 Sun_01_old#Do you have fun working on the farm?#$r 3 0 Sun_01_01#Yes.#$r 4 0 Sun_01_02#No." 
"$p 3#Hey, you've made another week of progress on the farm! It seems like things are going well for you.$h|Another tiring week on the farm, huh? It must really be a lot of work...$s" 
"Well that's good, isn't it?$h" 
"Yikes! I'm sorry. Have you ever thought of doing something different...?$s" 
"Stop by our house when you need to upgrade your buildings.#$e#It's always nice to have visitors." 
"My mother is a carpenter and my dad is a scientist. I guess it makes sense that I'm into building gadgets." 
"Sometimes my head gets so cluttered with nonsense I can hardly think. Does that ever happen to you?#$e#Getting some fresh air usually helps." 
"I work at Harvey's clinic on Tuesdays and Thursdays.#$e#He's nice, but not really my type..." 
"Oh, @! Is there anything you want to talk to me about?$l" 
"Of course he'll know the difference! This sample is completely ruined!$s" 
"Okay. I'll blame it on you, then.$u" 
"You're right. I should just tell him the truth.$u" 
"It's amazing, isn't it?" 
"I guess you could see it like that...$s#$b#But it's still incredible, isn't it?" 
"Oh no?$8#$b#Well, that makes me feel a little better, then. Thanks." 
"Oh no! Aghh... I'm really really sorry.$s" 
"Thanks. That means a lot to me, @.#$b#I know gadgets aren't really your kind of thing... but I do appreciate that you're showing interest in what I do.#$b#I wish I could return the favor somehow.$l" 
"What? After she said point-blank that she doesn't want to be a slave? How cold...$a" 
"Heh...$8#$b#Yeah I guess he did kinda say that, didn't he?$l#$b#...Um...$l" 
"...$8#$b#@...$8" 
"...$s#$b#You have a point, I did program her to act human... but her neural net is so complex, I can't be sure conciousness didn't emerge on its own.$8#$b#Furthermore, isn't it a little arrogant to assume that human-like consciousness is the only worthwhile vessel of existence? Computer brains are different than ours, but that doesn't mean we can disregard them.$8" 
"I see. Well it wasn't a very funny joke.$a" 
"That's horrible! What's gotten into you, @?$a#$b#I'm just going to forget about this conversation... you aren't acting yourself.$a" 
"This is going to be a great season for stargazing." 
"Hmm... What sort of gadget should I tinker with this summer?" 
"Come to my room if you ever want to tinker with my gadgets." 
"Sebastian is my half-brother, if you didn't know already.#$e#We look totally different." 
"Sebastian hardly ever talks to me. I wonder if he even likes me at all?#$e#It's sad, I want to have a brother but he doesn't act like one." 
"Are you enjoying the season?#$e#It's been so warm this year.$h" 
"Sorry, I was just thinking about some gadgets I'm making.#$q 35/36 Thu_01_old#I've decided I'm going to build a robot someday.#$r 35 30 Thu_0#That should be very easy for you#$r 36 -50 Thu_01_01#You should be more realistic#$r 35 40 Thu_01_02#It sounds challenging" 
"See you later." 
"Really? Are you sure you're not just trying to flatter me?" 
"You don't think I could do it?$s" 
"You're right, but I love a challenge!$h" 
"Hey, have any interesting farm stories to tell me?#$e#Guess not." 
"I worked at the clinic yesterday. We didn't have a single patient.#$e#I guess people get sick less during summer." 
"I bet you're growing some interesting crops right now.#$b#Dad says a lot of exotic plants grow in the valley this time of year." 
"Hey, tell me a story about farming.#$e#That's really interesting!" 
"Is it just me or did it suddenly get really hot?#$e#I guess it's just me." 
"Some day I'm going to be a world-class inventor.$u#$e#You're lucky to be friends with me!#$b#...just kidding." 
"@, you're looking sharp today.$h" 
"How do your hands stay so soft with all that farm work?" 
"Have you explored the mines much? I've heard you can find some useful materials there." 
"The trees look beautiful today!$h" 
"In other parts of the world it's spring right now. Imagine that!" 
"Bleh... I don't feel like working tomorrow." 
"I bet we'll start seeing more people at the clinic this season.$s#$e#I hope everyone stays healthy." 
"All these falling leaves will provide food for mushrooms and other small organisms.$u#$e#Interesting, isn't it?" 
"Hey, here's to another good week! *toast*" 
"@, I just love how the trees look right now!#$e#I know you like them too." 
"If you have any extra metal laying around, I could always use it for one of my projects.#$e#But only if you don't need it yourself." 
"I've been feeling especially optimistic lately...$h" 
"You should come visit me at the clinic Tomorrow. I work from 10 a.m.to 4 p.m.$h" 
"You have a leaf in your hair. Let me get it for you.#$e#...$h" 
"Oh man, it's so cold...$s" 
"Did you see the snowman I built?$h" 
"My hair gets so frizzy in this dry weather. *sigh*" 
"I guess winter is a good time to work on my gadgets.#$e#I wonder if I could make anything useful for farmers?" 
"Hey! What's up?#$e#It's a good time to explore the caves.#$e#I would go but my Dad would flip." 
"I hope I don't catch the flu this year." 
"Have you built a furnace yet?#$e#You can use them to turn raw material like ores into more useful products.$u" 
"I get so sleepy when it's cold..." 
"Hey, if any of your farming machines need to be fixed, just let me know.$h" 
"Hey, do you have any ideas for a new gadget I can make?#$e#Mhmm. I trust your opinion." 
"You look fresh today. I guess it's that crisp winter air." 
"Hi @!$h#$e#Hey, don't you think my snowman looks kind of like you?" 
"@, come closer. I'm cold.$l#$e#My hands are so dry from the winter air. I'm sorry about that.$l" 

"I wonder how Penny is doing? Maybe I'll give her a call later today." 
"I was just daydreaming... do you think MARILDA is okay? I hope she finds some place where she truly belongs..." 
"Hey! I had trouble sleeping last night so I fiddled around in my workshop for a bit. Here, I made this for you. [688 369 338 325 287]#$e#I hope you can find some use for it." 
"The only thing I dislike about rain is the fact that I can't do any stargazing!" 
"Do I hear a leak in the roof? I'll have to check it out. I know a thing or two about carpentry from watching my mother." 
"Make sure you don't leave your tools out in the rain! You wouldn't want them to get all rusty." 
"I'm not sure what this is, yet... but it's fun to turn the old wrench now and then." 
"Hi @. How was your day... soggy?#$e#This weather gives me gadget ideas... maybe if I funnel the rainwater it could power a mill?" 
"Dad's been tracking the weather patterns for the last twenty years.#$e#It's a little too early to tell, but the results have revealed some abnormal trends." 
"Can we have spaghetti in bed tonight?" 
"I made some dessert! Make sure to brush your teeth before bed, though. [232 234 223 220]$h" 
"My day wasn't all that exciting... I stayed inside because of the weather.#$e#It was relaxing, though. I kicked back with the latest 'Schematics Weekly'." 
"Hmm? Sorry, sometimes I get so lost in thought that I don't even realize what I'm doing." 
"I found this in my scrap pile. Think you could find a use for it? [286 287 205 732]" 
"Finally, you're up! I was getting so hungry... *rumble*$h" 
"One of the best things about living on the farm is waking up to a chorus of songbirds." 
"How do you keep your hands so soft with all that farmwork?" 
"Did you see the moon tonight? It always looks spectacular on the horizon." 
"I saw a shooting star earlier. I like to pretend it's MARILDA stopping by to check on us.$h" 
"I can't decide if I'm craving chocolate cake or ripe strawberries. Or maybe both...?#$e#Be honest... am I gaining weight?$s" 
"You did good work today! You deserve to relax the rest of the evening." 
"I'm really starting to love this old house. It's so cozy at night.#$e#Mom's done a great job improving the place.$h" 
"Ahh... the farm smells great, it reminds me of the mountains near my parent's house." 
"With a little planning, we could automate most of the farm work and just relax!" 
"It's going to be clear tonight... I wonder if the constellation will be visible?" 
"Don't worry, I won't mind if you track mud into the house. It's fun to get a little dirty now and then." 
"I never realized the amount of care and planning necessary to run a farm! It's a lot like working in the laboratory." 
"Have you spent any time with 1 today? Kids need playtime in order reach their full potential." 
"What do you think... will 1 grow up to be a farmer? Or an engineer?" 
"I have high hopes for our child. I've been reading all the scientific data on the best ways to raise children." 
"My own workshop, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. Life is pretty good." 
"Now that we live together, it's hard to imagine being alone again." 
"Taking a break? That's good!" 
"There's a lot of strategy to planning and running a farm. It's more intellectually stimulating than I thought!" 
"For a while there I was considering building a robotic husband. But you're a lot more fun!$h^For a while there I was considering building a robotic wife. But you're a lot more fun!$h" 
"I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. This is a very rare specimen!$l" 
"Last night, I had a dream that I was looking through a gigantic telescope. I saw something moving in the nebula. Kind of spooky." 
"I hope you'd still like me even if I gained weight." 
"I feel uninspired today.$s" 
"I think I'll visit my parents today. I haven't seen them in a while." 
"Mom and Dad are doing just fine. Their routine is still the same, even with me gone. How was your day?" 
"So, what's your strategy for optimizing the farm this year?" 
"It's wonderful to see all the plants and animals come back to life during the spring." 
"If my brother wasn't such a hermit I'd invite him over for dinner sometime." 
"I wonder if my brother will ever have the courage to ask Abigail out?" 
"I like to catalogue the different insects I see in summer." 
"With every season, a new section of the night sky becomes prominent. It's fascinating to witness." 
"Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house.#$e#Don't worry, dear. I'll take care of it all." 
"Fall aways reminds me of going out woodcutting with my mom... it might be that smell of freshly cut wood and sap." 
"The winters have been disturbingly mild lately." 
"I hope Dad's doing okay... he can get depressed in winter, when there's less opportunity for field research." 
"So, what are your plans for maintaining our income this winter?#$e#You could do some fishing or foraging...#$e#If you do any mining, promise me you'll be careful." 
"I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, @!$h" 
"The evenings are so warm, it's really the best time of year for stargazing. Who knows what might up there?" 
"The farm life is great, but I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community." 
"I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie in the spring. Oh... that tang, that zest!" 
"#$c .5#I got up early to do a little stargazing.#$e#I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey." 

"mumph... This is my one chance to pig out on barbecue sandwiches."
"*slurp* mmm... this barbecue sauce is amazing.$h"
"I'm confused... you go on ahead and let me figure this out."
"I think I've already been this way... no, wait...$s#$e#I'm lost...$s"
"I'm just catching up with Penny. Have you had your fill of eggs?"
"I always look forward to these gatherings... it makes the valley feel like a real community."
"Think you'll win the egg hunt this year?"
"I like dancing, but this one is a little stilted. The old timers really love it, though."
"Harvey keeps trying to talk to me, but all I want is a piece of this roast."
"Whatever Linus is roasting smells awfully good... *slurp*"
"It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner."
"I'm not very creative when it comes to snowmen.$s"
"Hey, @. I'm ready to head home whenever you are."
"Hi, @.$h"
