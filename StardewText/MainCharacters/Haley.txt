"I saw a dolphin on the way in!" 
"There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good." 
"It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?" 
"Wow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon!$h#$b#I bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo.#$e#I have to remember to bring my camera next time." 
"Getting the perfect tan is an artform...#$e#It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right.$h" 
"Laying out on a tropical beach.#$b#*sigh* I think I've finally found my place in the universe.#$e#But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either!$h" 
"Emily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City.#$e#City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it?$h"

"Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me!$h" 
"This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!" 
"Ew... No."

"Alright, alright... I'm done giving you the cold shoulder. Just promise me you'll never, ever lie to me again.$s" 
"This town is so small. It sucks.$u#$e#I have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes.$s#$e#That's why I usually just order online.#$e#What?" 
"Nice shoes.^Nice makeup.#$b#Are those made out of plastic?^Or wait... Are you even wearing any?#$e#I'm bored." 
"The only thing I like about this town is the beach.$u" 
"#$1 HaleyClothes#I've decided I am going to organize my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!#$e#*sigh* I could really go for a cupcake right now.#$e#Do you need something?" 
"Don't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do?#$e#I couldn't stand getting all dirty like that.#$e#You probably get a nice tan, though." 
"I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here." 
"My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related.$u" 
"There are only two things I like about this town.#$b#One of them is the beach.#$e#The other one is a secret! *giggle*$h" 
"I wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning?#$e#This isn't the best time of year for shells, though." 
"I'm glad that the flowers are starting to bloom.#$e#Those pink ones smell so good.$h" 
"I need to find some kind of hobby other than shopping.#$e#I've decided I want to expand my horizons.#$e#Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?" 
"I used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it.#$e#If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community." 
"I cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay!#$e#But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen..." 
"I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes." 
"#$1 haleySeagull#Yesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing.$k$s#$e#You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever."

"Him? No!#$b#...Well, I guess I used to like Alex. But not anymore! He's immature." 
"What? That sounds fun, but I wouldn't want to leave Stardew Valley right now..." 
"Huh? What's an android?" 
"I'm going to get such a nice tan this summer." 
"Ew, you're all dirty." 
"Um... Yes?#$e#I didn't hear you, I'm thinking about something else." 
"Do you have baby bunnies on your farm? Bunnies are SO cute! <" 
"If you stay in the sun a lot it'll make your hair lighter.#$e#It's a good thing to know!"

"Emily usually cooks dinner... But she makes weird stuff like quinoa." 
"Do you wear those clothes every day?" 
"$p 47#Hey I found this new tool to open jars with. So you won't need to help me anymore.$h|There's not a cloud in the sky today.$h" 
"It's so hot today!#$e#I wish I had some ice cream.$s" 
"I spent 3 hours practicing my signature today.#$e#I guess that's pretty silly, huh?" 
"If you stay in the sun a lot it will make your hair lighter... But you don't want to get sunburnt, either.#$e#I just want a healthy amount of sunlight. Everything in moderation, right?"

"I'll probably take a nap later." 
"Hmm... That's a pretty good idea, actually." 
"Get away from me, you stupid jerk.$a" 
"I've never been to the forest. It's muddy and I could get a blister on my foot." 
"Something smells earthy...#$b#Oh, right. You work on a farm." 
"You look like you've been doing a lot of hard work.#$b#Why don't you take the rest of the day off?"

"I'm going to start writing a list of all the clothes I need for next spring." 
"Do you have a pony on your farm?$h#$e#Oh. That's disappointing...$s" 
"The only good thing about winter is that I get to sleep more.#$e#I like at least 10 hours of sleep every night." 
"Will you say hi to Alex for me?#$e#Thanks." 
"Your name is @, right?#$e#I keep forgetting." 
"Hi @.#$e#Is anything exciting happening on your farm?" 
"I think I'm starting to realize that clothes aren't the most important thing. Right?#$e#I still like clothes, though. I mean, what's wrong with expressing yourself a little?" 
"Maybe I'll donate some of my skirts to a charity this spring.#$e#I mean, I do have over 1,000 skirts.$h#$e#...what?" 
"Um, if you see Alex could you tell him I'm busy today?#$e#Thanks."

"@, you look rugged today. I like it.^@, you look pretty today.#$e#...$h" 

"I've changed a lot over the years, but I still prefer sunny weather." 
"Sometimes I daydream about our retirement... relaxing on the sunny beaches of the Fern Islands!#$e#Do you ever think about the future, @?" 
"Good morning! I got up early and baked something sweet for you! [223 234 211 651 731]#$e#I know you're strong, but you still need to eat well to stay at your best!$h" 
"I can't go outside today... my hair will go limp. Forgive me, dear.$s#$e#I want to look my best for you." 
"Are you going out in this weather? Just make sure to wipe your boots on the way back in, honey.#$e#I'll just stay here and do some housework." 
"Say 'goat cheese'!" 
"Oh no... If this weather keeps up I'll get so pale.$s" 
"Oh, I'm glad you're back. It's so cold in here by myself... Are you almost ready to shut off the lights?" 
"I hope it's nice and sunny tomorrow morning. Too much rain can make me moody.$s" 
"I hope Emily isn't too lonely all by herself. I should visit her again soon.$7" 
"Rain is horrible for a photographer. The lighting is awful, and you can't go outside without ruining your equipment!$s" 
"I made a hot meal for you, honey. Lots of spice, just how you like it. Enjoy! [727 231 207 199]$h" 
"I never thought I'd say this, but the country lifestyle really suits me.$h" 
"Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely.$l" 
"Good morning! Did you sleep well?$h#$e#I think I might break out the old camera today... the lighting is just perfect."

"I'm glad I've learned to enjoy cleaning! The house gets dirty very easily.$10#$e#It's satisfying to get everything squeaky clean.#$e#Can I have a kiss before you leave?$11" 
"Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh?#$e#I'll be thinking of you. <$h" 
"I felt like I had no direction in life before I met you. Now I have exactly what I want.$l" 
"You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress.$l" 
"I always feel best when I'm outside, breathing fresh air.#$b#Don't get me wrong, your grandpa's old cottage is very nice! But nothing beats this beautiful landscape." 
"We've got to make sure the farm is cute! That might be important... right, honey?" 
"Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!#$e#I'll be thinking of you.$h" 
"I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right?#$e#*phew*... it's hot out here." 
"Don't overwork yourself, dear.#$e#Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.$h" 
"Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?" 
"I'm going to socialize in town for a bit today." 
"It was nice seeing everyone in town. Did you have a good day, dear?" 
"Isn't it strange? I'm not used to being a mother." 
"Isn't 2 a very good-looking baby?" 
"A big house, two kids, and a beautiful plot of land. I'm not sure what else I could ask for." 
"So, what are we planting this season?" 
"Now that winter's over, we've got lots of sunny weather to look forward to. I'm excited." 
"Sorry if I don't look my best... the air is just so humid that my hair doesn't hold up too well." 
"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies and ants... yuck.$s" 
"I already miss summer..." 
"Fall is kind of sad for me... everything is dying.$5" 
"My skin feels so dry in this weather." 
"For some reason, the snowy weather gives me cravings for pink cake..." 
"Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now." 
"I love watching the fireflies on a hot summer's night. It's the closest I'll ever come to visiting the stars." 
"Even though I prefer summer, fall might be the best season to take pictures. Those long, low shadows..." 
"I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles. Remember that?$h#$e#We've come a long way since then.$l" 

"Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year."
"Have you been to the fortune teller? She set up her stand in the graveyard.#$e#I already saw her... she told me something... interesting. *giggle*$h"
"I get scared easily... I think I'm just going to stay right here.$s"
"Eek! I'm too scared.$s"
"I was going to eat some eggs, but then I remembered I'm on a spring diet."
"This festival is alright... but what I'm really looking foward to is the Flower Dance."
"Oh! I still need to get my photo taken at the bunny stand. Does my hair look okay?"
"I'm practicing my dance moves... It needs to be perfect.#$e#I've been flower queen for the past 5 years and I'm not ready to step off the throne just yet!"
"Phew... I'm afraid to move, or else I might start to sweat."
"I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty."
"I should've brought my camera! I always forget.$s"
"Brr... my hands are freezing from making this snowman.$l"
"I guess Winter isn't all bad... playing in the snow can be fun!"
"Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight?$l"
"I hope there's a new camera for me under the spirit tree!"
