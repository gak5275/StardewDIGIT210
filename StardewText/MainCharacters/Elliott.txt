"Ah, the new farmer we've all been expecting... and whose arrival has sparked many a conversation!#$b#I'm Elliott... I live in the little cabin by the beach. It's a pleasure to meet you." 
"That was quite the ride!" 
"I'll see you back in the valley." 
"Hopefully a crab hasn't snuck onto my clothes again.$s#$b#Imagine crawling out of a pocket and finding yourself on a beach hundreds of miles from home!$h#$e#Hmmm... Perhaps this could make for an interesting novel..." 
"I'm just taking a quick break to slather some coconut oil on my body.$h" 
"Gus, I'll order a round for everyone!#$b#*hic*... Oh... I don't have the G.$s#$b#Heh heh... Never mind!" 
"I've heard rumors of pirates coming to shore near here at night. They say it can get pretty wild!" 
"I must admit, this beach blows my own humble strand out of the water." 
"Oh dear! Some seaweed has tangled itself in my hair.#$e#That's the trouble with relaxing on the beach." 
"Excuse me... not today.$s" 
"...$s#$e#Why do you torment me? Can't you see you've shattered all my hopes and dreams?$s" 
"Go away. I can't bear to see you.$s" 
"You've hurt me beyond measure... but I'm willing to leave the past behind us.$s" 
"Ah... the wilted bouquet. A sight I'd hoped to never see...$s#$b#I suppose there are other horizons to set my eyes upon...$s" 
"I'm kind of new to this town myself, but I really feel at home.$h#$e#I moved here only a year before you." 
"I hope you've come to think of this place as 'home'." 
"A great idea can pass through your head when you least expect it... but if your mind is too busy you might miss it.#$e#Well, I really must get back to my work." 
"The sweet friction of pen and paper is the music of my soul.$u#$b#That's why I chose this beach as my home, so that I could have peace and quiet to do my work." 
"The forest is a wonderful place. Have you been there?" 
"Sorry, I'm feeling morose today.$s#$e#I wish there was more certainty about the future.$s#$e#I don't want to grow old as a lonely hermit on this beach...$s" 
"I can't seem to find the inspiration to begin writing my novel...$s" 
"I've been feeling hopeful lately. Perhaps the weather is changing." 
"Sometimes I wonder if I might just have an inflated self-image and no real skills...$s#$e#No, no... I'm not fishing for compliments. Though they are appreciated..." 
"#$1 elliottApol#It's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend.$k#$e#It feels good to have a close friend like you." 
"Hello, @.#$e#Are you well?" 
"The fresh air of this valley is good for body and mind.#$e#A quick stroll outdoors always invigorates me." 
"Ah... do not get too close to my hair with a torch...$8" 
"I'll admit... it takes me several hours each morning to make my hair look this good." 
"You probably wouldn't like it inside my cabin. It's dark and full of spiders.$s" 
"Please excuse the sorry state of my cabin." 
"Some people are shy. Keep showing interest in them and they'll get comfortable around you.#$e#Everyone likes to have friends, even that grumpy blacksmith." 
"Hello. I hope your new farming life is panning out as you'd hoped?" 
"Oh, @! I was hoping you'd show up.#$e#It's always a pleasure to see you.$h" 
"Mystery, huh? It's definitely an exciting genre. I'll remember that." 
"Ah, one of the classic genres. I'll remember that." 
"I would've never guessed! I suppose even those of the 'earthiest' profession sometimes have their heads in the stars.$h#$b#I'll remember that." 
"... I was worried you might not feel this way about another man.$l^So am I.$l" 
"Oh! I'm so sorry.$8" 
"Well...okay.#$b#Here's to @!" 
"That's a great idea!$h#$b#Here's to us!" 
"Hmmph...forget it.$a" 
"Ah, to a harmonious future for the community... what a virtuous idea.#$b#Here's to Pelican Town!" 
"A gentle little sunbeam woke me up this morning. I've never felt so refreshed.$u#$e#I'm sorry if that isn't very interesting to you." 
"I know that I am kind of an 'oddball'.#$e#I hope you don't mind.$h" 
"@, I know you have faith in my abilities as a writer. That means a lot to me.$h" 
"I've encountered some beautiful shells in front of my house.#$e#I would imagine the rarer varieties to be quite valuable." 
"I write in hopes of connecting with others through time and space.$u#$e#*sigh*...times are changing, though. People don't read anymore.$s" 
"It must be satisfying to follow your crop from seed to harvest.#$e#It's as if your essence is infused into the fruit.$u" 
"Oh dear! My shoes are filled with sand.$s#$e#That's the trouble with living on the beach." 
"@? You look puzzled.#$b#I guess the hot summer air can make us a little dizzy." 
"The sun is angry today... My skin is a bit too delicate, I'm afraid." 
"You came all the way here just to talk to me? How kind.$h" 
"Visit my cabin whenever you like. I could use the company.$h" 
"Hello @.#$e#Make sure and take breaks from your work now and then." 
"Come visit me if you need a break from your labors.$h#$e#I'm usually at my house." 
"It's been said that a pirate's ship, full of plundered gold, shipwrecked here a long time ago." 
"@, I was just thinking about you.$l#$e#Maybe you sensed it.$h#$e#So! Tell me about your day." 
"I wouldn't mind trying my hand at farming.#$e#The quiet atmosphere of a farm might be a good source of literary inspiration, don't you think?$h" 
"Oh dear! A tiny crab appears to have made his home in my shirt pocket.$l#$e#That's the trouble with living on the beach." 
"My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all night.$s#$e#Sometimes I envy you, @." 
"My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all morning.$s" 
"@, when you're around... I feel unusually creative.$l#$e#I know... strange, but it's true." 
"It gets windy this time of year. Marvelous!$h" 
"I have to remember to water my plants today. And not with sea water this time!" 
"You've come to visit me in the cold?#$e#I could do with a respite from my lonely labors." 
"@, you've trudged through the snow to visit me?#$e#I'm honored!$h" 
"People have scraped a living off the sea for thousands of years.#$e#I just go to the grocery store.$s" 
"@, I had a feeling that you would show up.#$e#Perhaps we're connected by an other-worldly thread.$l" 
"A day can never be boring when you follow the whims of your imagination.$u#$e#Sorry, am I babbling on about nonsense?" 
"Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea.#$e#How does it make you feel?" 
"Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea.#$e#Whenever I smell the sea, it reminds me of my youth. The ocean really impressed me as a child." 
"I have to brush my hair daily, or else it'll clump up into messy knots.#$e#It's a lot of work.#$e#I'm surprised I haven't just shaved it off in a fit of passion.$h#$e#I suppose I am too vain." 
"I've been doing little indoor exercises, since it's often too cold to go out.#$e#Sorry if it's a little humid in the cabin.$s" 
"I really should scrub my floorboards today. I think an algae is starting to form.$s#$e#Do you make time for cleaning?" 

"I feel inspired today... I think I'll do some writing." 
"The sound of rain, in some tiny way, reminds me of my cabin by the beach.#$e#The farm is wonderful, but I do miss the sound of the ocean." 
"I got up early and made coffee.[395]#$e#I find that a cup of this exquisite brew makes the early morning a lot more pleasant." 
"I think I'll remain indoors today, my dear. The rain causes my hair to go limp." 
"My inspiration for writing is like the weather... it comes and goes at random. Today I feel entirely dull.$s#$e#Perhaps I'll read one of the classics to get my creative juices flowing." 
"Ah, what a lovely day to read a book... don't you think, my dear?" 
"Good evening. Did you have a productive day, @?^Good evening. Did you have a productive day, my dear?" 
"You're ice cold! Let me keep you warm.$l" 
"My skill with words is unmatched, yet I can't find the way to properly describe your allure.$l^My skill with words is unmatched, yet I can't find the way to properly describe your beauty.$l" 
"What did I do today? I'll just say this... it takes a lot of work to maintain this rugged physique!" 
"I spent the afternoon daydreaming about the ocean. So I decided to cook some seafood. [198 202 727 728]$h" 
"I've been taking much better care of myself now that we're together. The bachelor life wasn't particularly healthy for me." 
"Good morning, @! I made us a pot of coffee.[395]#$e#I find myself craving this robust flavor nearly every morning." 
"If you find a spider in the house, don't squash it! Just let me know and I'll take the poor thing outside." 
"Today is going to be a fantastic day... I can feel it!$h#$e#I get this special feeling in my nose..." 
"I've had this recurring nightmare that you gave me a buzz cut... You wouldn't ever do that to me, would you?$s#$e#I trust you." 
"From the brightest winter star, to the shimmer of an iridium vein... nothing can compare to my wonderful man.$l^From the brightest winter star, to the fragrant fairy rose... nothing can compare with your captivating beauty.$l" 
"A crackling fire adds wonderful ambience to the house... every piece of wood burns in a unique way." 
"I never had much success growing plant in my old beach house. Hopefully I can pick up a thing or two by watching you.#$e#In this respect, you are the master and I only a humble apprentice." 
"When I behold thy wondrous face, a precious jewel of form and grace, my heart... torn by the dread of night, is purified with golden light.#$e#Poetry is the only way I can begin to describe my feelings for you.$l" 
"My love... I wouldn't trade you for 100 iridium bars.#$e#Nor 1000...#$e#Not even 10,000 bars, no.$7#$e#...$7#$e#No, not even 100,000 bars!$a#$e#...$s#$e#Wa... one million bars of pure iridium...? Don't make me do this...$8" 
"My wildest dreams have come true... just look at this incredible landscape!" 
"Fertile soil beneath my feet, fresh air to fill my lungs, and the sun's warmth to delight my skin... Life is going well." 
"I might stay here and write some poetry. I'm feeling a sudden surge of creativity! You go on ahead and take care of business." 
"If I stay perfectly still, perhaps a resplendent butterfly will bless my nose with a landing." 
"I drank too much coffee... my mouth feels about as dry as the Calico Desert.$s#$e#Oh... sorry about the coffee breath.$7" 
"Have you had any time to entertain little 1 today? Maybe a second child will make things easier for both of us." 
"Little 1 is going to have the perfect childhood here. There's so much to explore." 
"Caring for babies isn't exactly my strong suit... but I'll do my best to be a good father." 
"I already gave 1 and 2 their food. They eat a lot for such small creatures!" 
"I was carrying 1 earlier, and I could've sworn I heard a \"Da...da\".$h" 
"I'm going to teach 1 to read as soon as possible! That's a great way for children to learn about the world." 
"We've done well, @. The farm is doing excellent and our healthy children are a great joy. I couldn't be happier." 
"@... I'm so proud of all your hard work. I'm very lucky to have you.$l" 
"I made a whole secret book of poems expressing my love for you.$l" 
"I came to the valley to find the ivory tower from which my talents could reign supreme. But what I really found was a dungeon of loneliness. You saved me from that.$l" 
"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave? Your jawline is perfect.$l^Your feminine allure is irresistible today. I can't keep my eyes off you.$l" 
"I feel burnt out in your absence. But when I hear that sound of muddy boots on wood, my heart rises from the ash." 
"I'm doing a walking meditation. It's good for creativity." 
"Be careful out there! I do worry about you sometimes. There are people in the world who would take advantage of you." 
"I think I'll walk down to the beach today. It's always nice to see the ocean again." 
"I had a nice time at the beach by myself. I watched the waves come and go, just like old times." 
"My new year's resolution is to write, write, and write! I can never stop improving my skills." 
"It's strange, but I often have cravings for pomegranate in the spring." 
"I look forward to dancing with you tomorrow, my dear." 
"It's hard to be in a foul mood when the sun is beaming and the butterflies are dancing on a spice-berry breeze.$h" 
"I was going to grab an extra bottle of ink from my cabin today, but then I remembered the Luau is tomorrow. I'll just do it then." 
"All good things must come to an end, including the joyful days of summer. The key to happiness is to accept change without judgement." 
"The splendor of fall... a verdant banquet for all the senses to enjoy... has inspired some of the greatest poetry of all time." 
"I might set my pride aside and sink my eager teeth into a sloppy, saucy barbecue sandwich tomorrow." 
"Would you still love me if I guzzled two gallons of pumpkin ale at the Spirit's Eve festival? Sometimes a man has primitive urges..." 
"Winter is a great time to read books and play the piano. Remember to pause and enjoy a quiet moment or two." 
"I'm a little out of practice, but I plan on entering the fishing contest tomorrow! You've got some stiff competition, dear." 
"Happy new year's eve, my dear. Please accept this to celebrate. [348]" 

"The smokey aroma drew me here, yet 'twas the zesty sauce that truly sealed my fate... *gurgle*$s"
"I'm trying to get Gus to tell me his sauce recipe, but he won't budge."
"Mmph... I believe I've eaten a few too many slices of pumpkin pie."
"Why, hello @. It's chilly, isn't it?"
"I enjoy seeing you so relaxed, my dear.$h"
"Taking breaks from work can make you more productive in the long run."
"Be careful you don't accidentally take a raven's egg. They'll hold a grudge against you for the rest of their days!"
"I wore my best shirt for the dance... This sort of thing doesn't happen very often!"
"The old cabin seems to be holding up well. Every time I return I half expect the thing to be rotted..."
"I woke up late, stepped out of the door and found myself in the middle of all this hubbub!#$e#I forgot that today was the Luau.$h"
"If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct. It's already in the process of happening.#$e#What a shame... we have no respect for nature anymore."
"I know you'll beat me in the fishing competition, but I don't mind. I'm just here for the fun of it.$h"
"I'm entering the ice fishing competition today. Why not?#$e#It's rare that Willy ever loses, though."
"You don't need to get me anything, you've already given me the greatest gift of all...$l"
"Why, hello @. It's chilly, isn't it?"
