"Oh. You just moved in, right? Cool.#$e#Out of all the places you could live, you chose Pelican Town?" 
"I liked the boat ride. At one point you couldn't see any land at all.." 
"I'm ready to get back home." 
"The beach is nice, but I don't love the crowds." 
"You think Willy would let me lug a jet ski out here?#$b#...Nah.$h" 
"...Now, if I were a tropical frog, where would I hide...$h" 
"I bet this place looks pretty cool in the rain." 
"It's good to get away from the computer and see the real world sometimes. I forget how nice it can be.$h" 
"I usually wear black, but in this heat..." 
"No... There's someone else I want to dance with." 
"Why do you keep bothering me? I'm trying to forget about you.$s" 
"I don't want to see you for a while.$u" 
"... alright...$s#$b#I guess I'll see you around, then...$s" 
"Hey..." 
"Um... need something?" 
"If I just disappeared would it really matter?$s" 
"I was thinking... people are like stones skipping over the water.#$b#Eventually we're going to sink." 
"I like your new boots!$h^Your hair looks nice today.$h#$e#Do you want to hang out for a while?" 
"What am I going to do today?#$e#Probably nothing." 
"Sam is probably my only friend in this town.#$e#Well, Abby is nice too, but...$h#$e#Umm.. nevermind." 
"Sam is probably my only friend in this town, anymore..." 
"You and Sam are probably my only friends in this town.$s" 
"Um... You're single, right?#$e#Just wondering!$l" 
"#$1 Sebastian1#I snuck into the caves last night and got a nasty cut from a rock crab. Don't tell anyone, okay?#$e#Hi.#$e#...want something?" 
"I come here for the peace and quiet." 
"Why does everyone like Maru so much? Sure, she's smart and friendly, but don't they realize it's all just an attention-grabbing scam?#$e#Sorry...$s" 
"Could you picture someone like me living on a farm? It seems ridiculous.$h" 
"Could you picture me living on a farm?#$e#It seems ridiculous, but I have been thinking about it lately." 
"Uh... I don't really know you." 
"*sigh*... If gas wasn't so expensive I'd ride my motorcycle to the city today.#$e#$q 15/16 Fri_old#So what do you do when you aren't working?#$r 15 0 Fri_bad#More Farming#$r 16 30 Fri_good#Comic books#$r 15 -30 Fri_bad#Shopping#$r 15 -30 Fri_bad#Sports" 
"$p 16#Hey, if you're bored feel free to hang out in my room...$h|You probably prefer the small-town life, huh?" 
"Oh yeah? Well, did you read the new 'Cave Saga X'? I won't spoil it for you, but oh man...$h" 
"Oh yea? Hmm... Not really my thing, but everyone's different I guess.$u" 
"What? I didn't hear you... I'm busy thinking about something.#$e#What do you want?" 
"You know, I should be doing something productive right now. I just lose focus too fast...$s#$b#Maybe I should drink more coffee?" 
"Hey. Your name is @, right?" 
"Having a good weekend? ...nice." 
"I usually stay inside, but I do go to the beach now and then.#$b#Pretty much only when it's raining, though.#$e#For some reason, staring off into the bleak horizon makes me feel... I dunno. Like it's worthwhile to keep pushing on, I guess." 
"What's new?$h#$e#I'll be at the saloon tonight destroying Sam at pool again.$h" 
"I was just thinking about you...$l" 
"Okay, that'll work." 
"Good choice. That works well with my role." 
"Not so fast! I want to know what it is." 
"Really? It was making a lot of noise!" 
"It's too dangerous without a sword. But I like your sense of adventure.$h" 
"Great.$8" 
"Okay... Nevermind then.$9" 
"Don't worry, I'll make sure to show you the ropes before I let you do anything dangerous.$8^There's no need to worry... I'll make sure you're safe.$8" 
"Hmm... Not exactly how I'd put it but, yeah." 
"Yea... That's exactly how I feel, too.$l" 
"Oh... Well maybe this wasn't the right place to bring you, then. I thought you'd see the beauty in it.$s" 
"Ugh... You sound like my Mom.$a#$b#...*sigh*$s#$b#You're right, though. I'm addicted to these things, it's not good.$s" 
"Everyone is so happy in the sun. I don't get it." 
"Everyone is so happy when it's sunny out...#$e#Different people like different things, I guess." 
"I'm looking forward to the cold, damp season. I feel more at home." 
"What's the point of going outside? I've already seen it all." 
"Why am I grinning? I guess I've been unusually happy lately...$l" 
"I definitely don't want to go swimming, if that's what you're going to ask.$s#$e#Oh, you just stopped to say hi? Sorry." 
"If you ever wanted to go swimming... I guess I'd do it.$l" 
"#$c .5#The temperature only starts to get comfortable at night.#$e#It always seems to stay a little cooler by the lake." 
"Oh, hey. *yawn*" 
"Hey, I'm glad you stopped by.$h#$e#How have you been coping with this heat?" 
"I hope we're not having mushroom casserole tonight...$s" 
"I'm not too big on festivals. Lots of commotion, too much social interaction... More stress than fun, if you ask me." 
"Ugh... Tomorrow is the worst festival of the year by a mile. Just wait and see how stupid I look during the flower dance." 
"Are you looking forward to the Spirit's Eve festival? It's probably my favorite.$h" 
"The Spirit's Eve festival is tomorrow. I really hope they have those skeletons on display again this year.$h#$e#I almost feel like they're my friends at this point." 
"Hehe... It might be funny to put something disgusting in the potluck soup tomorrow. Just don't poison anyone.#$e#Why ruin the potluck? Hmm... I guess some people feel liberated when the rigid structures of society break down a little. Maybe I'm weird." 
"Tomorrow we'll all be gathering at the docks to see the migration of the moonlight jellies. I think it starts at ten o'clock." 
"It's the eve of the winter star today. Better make sure you've got an empty stomach for the feast tomorrow." 
"I usually only go outside after dark. Does that sound weird to you?" 
"Last night, I saw a group of bats flying around near the lake.#$e#I guess maybe they are feeding on the mosquitoes this time of year?" 
"So... it's the big harvest season, isn't it?" 
"You're probably making a lot of money on your farm, huh?#$e#I guess I should get a job soon...$s" 
"Pumpkin spice this... pumpkin spice that... man, I do get sick of these seasonal fads." 
"Who does Demetrius think he is, telling me what to do? He's not even my real father.$a" 
"*yawn*... what time is it? I think I slept too much last night." 
"I'm glad you showed up. I was starting to get bored.#$e#Now I feel a lot more energetic, believe it or not." 
"My room might be a little less depressing if I had a window...$s" 
"*yawn*... I was up until 3 reading this new book...#$q 62/63 fall_Fri_old#Do you read, @?#$r 62 -30 Fri_bad#Yep. The classics.#$r 63 30 Fri_good#Only Sci-fi and Fantasy#$r 62 0 Fri_bad#I like a good Romance#$r 63 -30 Fri_bad#No, I don't read books" 
"$p 62#You probably wouldn't like it.$s|I think you'd like it." 
"Hey, me too. There's nothing like a good fiction to push the boundaries of the imagination.$h" 
"Huh. Sounds boring." 
"I've been reading a book about a farmer. Reminds me a lot of you, actually.$h#$e#Sorry if that creeps you out.$h" 
"I was *this* close to moping in bed the entire day. Kinda wish I had, now." 
"The sun is coming out less and less these days... wonderful." 
"I'm enjoying this gloomy weather... although I have to say, it's a little cold." 
"Nothing surprises me anymore... nothing makes me laugh.#$e#Yeah, I know... I'm being a little dramatic." 
"Hmm... I don't really have anything to say. I still don't know you very well." 
"Hey...#$b#It's hard to think of new things to talk about, sometimes. Even after you know someone.#$e#...Sorry." 
"I was so close to screaming at Mom for throwing away my old comic collection... But something stopped me.#$e#Hmm... with age comes wisdom." 
"You came here to see me?$l#$e#...$h" 
"Hey, don't let me stop you from getting your work done.#$e#If you aren't busy I don't mind if you stick around.$h" 
"I wonder what's for dinner tonight... *grumble*$s" 
"I should learn how to cook. That would be useful." 
"It's fun to live so close to the train tracks. It's a reminder that there's a big world out there." 
"When I was younger I'd run out to the railroad whenever I heard a train coming.#$e#Whatever happened to those days...? *sigh*$s" 
"The frogs aren't very happy in winter.#$e#Poor little guys.$s" 
"I like winter but I do feel bad for all the cold animals out there.#$e#I guess they're used to it, though... like me." 
"I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it.#$e#What's his problem?$u" 
"I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it... yet Maru's cute little snowman goes unharmed!$a#$e#Ridiculous." 

"Finally... some heavy rain. I get bored of sunny weather easily." 
"Hey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell...#$e#I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long." 
"Hey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this... want it?[575 769 767 84 66 78]#$e#I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you.$7" 
"Seems like a pretty good day to just lay around, maybe read a book or something... what do you think?" 
"Hey, another rainy day... perfect.#$e#You look cold... here, come closer.$l" 
"I'm trying my best to quit smoking now that we're married... I don't wanna die on you. It's a bad habit.#$e#I want to have a future together.$l" 
"Need something? I'll just be over here working on my bike for a while." 
"I did some work on the laptop today. I was actually brainstorming some ideas for a game I want to make.#$e#With your farming income, I can afford to do what I want with my life. It's pretty amazing. Thank you.$h" 
"Sorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something.#$e#I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores..." 
"How was your day? Did you slay any monsters?$h#$e#It feels good to take out your aggression now and then, doesn't it?" 
"Maybe a witch will visit us tonight? Hah.. if only life was that interesting..." 
"The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy.#$e#The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner." 
"Hey... want some coffee?[395]$7#$e#I needed some... woke up early from a nightmare and I just couldn't fall back asleep." 
"I couldn't sleep last night so I went for a night ride on the motorcycle.#$e#I need to stay independent, even though we're married. That's just how I am. I still love you, though.$7" 
"Hey. How'd you sleep last night? I heard you mumbling.#$e#You seemed scared, but I have to admit... it was kind of cute.$l" 
"Living here with you is teaching me to come out of my shell a little bit. I think it's good for me.$7" 
"Hey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting...#$e#...#$e#The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch." 
"Maybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired.#$e#I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes.$h" 
"It's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time.#$e#I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone." 
"I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there." 
"I often felt unappreciated back home... but here I feel like I really belong. Thanks for making me feel welcome, @.$l" 
"I feel like I want to do something today... but I'm not sure what. Do you ever have that problem, @?" 
"Hmm... sometimes I have to force myself to stay outside for health.#$e#I dunno what it is, but I like being indoors. Maybe I'm just so used to my dark basement." 
"I'll just watch you from here.$h#$e#I enjoy watching you." 
"I don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out?#$e#Just an idea...$h" 
"We should raise more slimes... In big quantities they can be pretty profitable. And they're so easy to raise.#$e#Also, different colored slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us." 
"I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of 1! It's just... something new." 
"Maybe when 1 is a little older, I'll get a sidecar for the bike and we can all go for a ride.$h" 
"Have you smelled 1? Maybe it's time for a bath..." 
"Don't worry, I already fed the kids... 2 spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again." 
"I hope 1 and 2 are nice to each other. Maru and I always fought as kids.#$e#If I think back on it, it was mostly my fault..." 
"I've had this recurring dream that 2 is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?" 
"We've come a long way, @. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation.#$e#Now that I'm here, I like it...$l" 
"Hey. Look at me. Never forget that I love you... you're everything to me.$l#$b#Now go make us some money.$h" 
"Hey... come here. You look great today.$l" 
"You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day.$l" 
"I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made.$l" 
"You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone." 
"Sometimes I feel so angry... but when you show up I always start to calm down.$7#$e#Maybe I'll mellow out with age." 
"I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?" 
"I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV." 
"I don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird?#$e#I guess I'm not like most people." 
"When I take walks I do my best to avoid everyone. I hate being pressured into small talk." 
"Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now..." 
"Are you going into town today? Why, what are you up to?" 
"I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm." 
"Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop..." 
"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways." 
"House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast." 
"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?" 
"What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away.$a" 
"This place is starting to feel like a tomb.$s" 
"I started smoking again... I've just been really stressed out lately.$s" 
"I'm going to take a walk today. I need some time to myself. I'll see you in the evening." 
"My day was fine, nothing much to tell you about. Why don't you tell me about yours?" 
"Oohh... my head. Happy new year...$h" 
"Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be good to see Sam again." 
"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? Do we have to go?#$e#I hate wearing that ridiculous tight jumpsuit. Why does Lewis make us do this?$s" 
"Summer's here... I need to start slathering the sunscreen pretty thick if I want to maintain my pale complexion..." 
"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?#$e#I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!$7" 
"The weather's starting to cool off. It feels great.#$e#Should we go to the festival tomorrow night? It's actually a tradition I kind of enjoy.$7" 
"It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here." 
"The Stardew Valley Fair is a little crowded for my tastes... but I'll just hang out with Sam. It'll be good to catch up with him.#$e#You should play some carnival games, though! Don't worry about me.$7" 
"I'm excited for the Spirit's Eve tomorrow. I wonder what horrors we'll find there.$h" 
"What are your plans this winter? I know it's more of a laid-back time for you." 
"Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?" 
"It's been a great year, @. We should celebrate a little. [346]$h#$e#I'm sure next year will be even better.$7" 

"Hey, @. I'm just catching up with Sam. Go ahead and have some fun."
"It's kinda hectic today... I'm just gonna hang out here for a while."
"It would be interesting to have one of these on the farm."
"I have no idea how these skeletons are walking... creepy.#$e#It's pretty cool though."
"I'll be rooting for you in the egg hunt.$h"
"We used to do a rotten egg toss...#$b#Mayor Lewis put an end to that pretty quick."
"You know what? I kind of miss the winter... it's simpler, in a way."
"Ugh..."
"I'm doing my best to stay in a good mood..."
"One year Sam put a pound of anchovies in the potluck soup.#$e#Ever wondered why Sam leads the town in community service hours?$h"
"I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark.#$e#Just trying to scare you...$h"
"Don't worry about me, I never get cold..."
"Cold? Nah, I never get cold."
"Hey, @. As you can see, I'm fulfilling my family obligations..."
"Spending time with family is tiring sometimes."
