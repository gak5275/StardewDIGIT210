"Oh, hey. So you're the new guy, huh? Cool.^Hey, you're the new girl, huh? I think we're going to get along great. I'm Alex.#$e#I'll see you around." 
"Finally, we're here!" 
"Aw... I guess it can't last forever.$s" 
"I knew I shoulda brought a frisbee... Oh well.$h" 
"I wonder if anyone would be up for a volleyball tournament.#$e#Don't worry, I'll go easy!$h" 
"I wonder how far I could swim out, and still make it back?#$e#I'm guessing at least a mile.#$b#... Don't worry, I'm not going to try it.$h" 
"Aren't you hot in that outfit? C'mon, man... It's the beach!^Aren't you hot in that outfit? You gotta get some ocean breeze goin'!" 
"With this island open, there's no excuse to be pasty anymore!" 
"Phew, it feels good to finally get these abs a little sunlight.#$e#Kind of a shame to have them hidden away all the time back home." 
"When I go pro, I'll vacation on islands all around the world.#$e#But for now, this place will do just fine!$h" 
"I'm ordering a banana shake with two scoops of protein powder." 
"Ah... The island life. I could get used to this!" 
"Nah... I'm gonna ask someone else. Good luck." 
"I thought we had something special... I guess I was wrong.$s" 
"You're not worth my time.$a" 
"I don't know if I can trust you anymore, but I'm willing to give you a chance.$9" 
"You're giving me wha...?$7#$b#*huff*... Got it. Alright... well, you've made your choice. You're not gonna see me begging.$a" 
"Did you know I was an all-star quarterback in high school? It's true.$u#$e#See this little star on my jacket here? That proves it." 
"The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays.#e#You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale.#$e#*sigh*... I wish there were more girls in this town, know what I mean?$s^Hey, do you wanna hang out with me at the beach some time? Do you have a bikini?" 
"Looks like a good day to play catch, huh?$u#$e#$q 5/6 Wed_01_old#I'd ask you to throw the ball around, but you don't really seem like the sports type.^If you weren't a girl I'd ask you to play catch.#$r 6 0 Wed_01_02#I'm fine just watching you from a distance.#$r 5 15 Wed_01_01#I want to play catch with you!#$r 5 0 Wed_01_03#(angry) What's that supposed to mean?" 
"#$p 5#Go long! ...just kidding. Hahaha.|I just wish I had someone to play catch with...$s" 
"Really? I guess I underestimated you.#$b#My arm's a little sore, but maybe next time." 
"Yeah, some people just aren't made for sports." 
"Uh... nevermind." 
"The air's starting to warm up... I'm feeling pumped." 
"Hey, what's up farmer guy?^Hey, it's farm girl. Did you get new pants? You're doing something right.#e#Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups!#e#Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?" 
"My arms are really sore, but that's the sign of progress for a guy like me.#e#I must've done a thousand push-ups yesterday." 
"Hey.#$e#What, you wanna talk to me? I'm busy." 
"Hey, @.#$e#That's right, I remember your name." 
"Hey, @.#$e#How's your day going?" 
"Hey, @. I'm glad you stopped by.#e#I'm not ashamed to say that I love my Grandma!#$e#Now Grandpa, on the other hand...#$e#Just kidding.$h" 
"Nothing's better than an energetic day at the beach with your friends... right?" 
"You know, I used to want fame and fortune, but lately I've been starting to sing a different tune. In the end it's the humble little things that satisfy, don't you think?#$e#I still want to go pro, but it's not the most important thing in the world." 
"Hi @. You look sporty today.$h^Hey @. Did you do something different with your hair? Something keeps grabbing my attention.$h" 
"I've been having a hard time staying focused lately.$l" 
"Of course you do. If you didn't I'd think you were crazy. Or some kind of nerd." 
"Really? You must be some kind of weirdo.$a#$b#Sorry." 
"No, I'm not! You're just trying to flatter me.$a" 
"Yeah, I guess you're right...$s" 
"You were supposed to disagree with me.$a" 
"Yes... I know. That's why I've been so determined to be successful with my sports stuff...$9#$b#Make it or not... As long as I try my hardest I think she'd be proud. Thanks." 
"Wow... It's the anniversary of my Mom's death! Have a heart...$a" 
"...Thanks, @.#$b#You... you're different than the other guys. More sensitive.$l^You've become my best friend in the whole town... #$b#I'm glad.^Is that embarrassing to say?$l" 
"That doesn't make me feel any better, jerk.$a" 
"That's an interesting thought..." 
"They would never do that!$a" 
"...Maybe you're right... I dunno.$s" 
"Hey. Summer is definitely the best time of year.#$e#Right now is great because we've got the whole season to look forward to. Catch you later." 
"Hey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt.^Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going.$h#$e#The more I practice this summer, the easier it'll be for me to go pro.#$e#Then you'd be able to say you knew me once. Cool, huh?" 
"If my hair wasn't so popular with the ladies, I swear I'd shave it all off in a second.#$e#*sigh*... Life can be tough." 
"Hey farm guy, I've got a question for you.^Hey Farm girl, I've got a question for you.#$b#$q 52/53 summer_Wed_01_old#Do you think I'll ever turn pro?#$r 52 30 summer_Wed_01_01#You're destined to be a sports legend#$r 52 0 summer_Wed_01_02#Maybe, if you practice a lot#$r 53 -50 summer_Wed_01_03#No, you'll most likely fail and become a salesman" 
"$p 52#Hey, when I turn pro you can say you were my first \"fan\". Not bad, huh?|Hey, I've been practicing twice as hard so I can turn pro and prove you wrong. You just wait.$a" 
"Hey, now that's what I'm talking about!$h#$e#You're cooler than I thought." 
"Yeah, well I'm so good I'm not going to have to practice all that much.$u" 
"That's insane. You're just jealous that I'm talented and popular and you're not.$a^That's ridiculous. You're just jealous that I'm way more popular than you'll ever be, freak.$a#$e#Get away from me.$a" 
"Hey, you must be getting pretty strong working on that farm all day.^Hey, you must be getting pretty fit working on that farm all day.#$e#Maybe you'll reach my level some day. Something to look forward to, huh?#$e#Why do you have that look on your face?" 
"What do you want?#$e#I've got more important things to do right now." 
"Mmmm... I smell a barbeque.#$e#Damn I could go for a burger." 
"I got these new shoes yesterday 'cuz my old pair had a brown smudge.#$b#I just threw them into the garbage. I would've donated them but I don't like the idea of some weirdo wearing my shoes, ya know?#$e#...What?$a" 
"Oh wow...your shoes are a little dirty... but that's fine, too!#$e#Different people have different tastes I guess." 
"Hey, you look like you're getting into some good shape this summer!#$b#All that farm work is paying off, huh?" 
"Hey, nice tan." 
"Sorry my room is so messy.$s#$e#It's just hard to always remember to clean. I'm trying to get better, though." 
"You know, I actually wouldn't mind being a farmer... it seems a lot like playing sports, in a way.#$e#I like being outdoors and doing things with my hands." 
"I've been trying to do more reading lately... I feel like I've been neglecting my brain for years because of my athletic obsession." 
"Sure, it's getting colder... But it's still warm enough for sports!#$e#That's all I care about." 
"My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying.#$e#I was like, '...Grams, don't fret. I'm turning pro!'$h#$e#Studying is for nerds, anyway." 
"Hey, I want to ask you something.^Hey, can I ask you something?#$e#$q 54/55 fall_Wed_01_old#Do you think the ladies like my haircut?^What do you think about my haircut?#$r 54 30 fall_Wed_01_01#It looks very fashionable.#$r 55 -30 fall_Wed_01_02#It looks like some kind of fungal growth." 
"I put too much gel in my hair today. It kind of hurts.#$e#Don't touch it!#$e#...what?" 
"Yeah, I know. That's why I have it like this." 
"Yeah right. You're just jealous that I look so good." 
"What's up?#$e#Isn't your name, like, , or something?#$e#Oh. It's @? Okay. Sorry." 
"I'm going to do two hundred sit-ups tonight.#$b#I'm pretty dedicated, aren't I?$h#$e#Need anything else?" 
"I think you can find salmon in the river this time of year.#$e#At least that's what I heard." 
"Hey, the gridball game is on today!#e#Sundays are pretty awesome in the fall.$u" 
"What's up, @?" 
"I'm going to do a ton of sit-ups tonight.#$e#You have to work really hard if you want to achieve your maximum potential." 
"My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying.#$e#Maybe she's right...$s" 
"I finally took the plunge... I've decided to stop putting gel in my hair.#$e#I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who only liked me because I have gel in my hair." 
"@! Um... Hi.$l" 
"Winter is kind of lame. There's too much snow to do anything fun.#$e#I guess some people like it." 
"You like the snow? Me... I'm just looking forward to spring." 
"Hey, can you go find Haley and tell her I said 'hi'?" 
"Oh, hey. How's the married life coming along?$9" 
"People stay indoors a lot during the winter, and do boring stuff.$s#$e#Maybe if I read a book I'd be less bored... nah." 
"When I turn pro, I'll be so rich that I'll get a vacation home in the tropics.#$e#Then I won't have to deal with these boring winters." 
"You came all the way through the snow to see me?#$e#I guess that makes sense." 
"There's some weird people living in this town.#$e#...like that guy Sebastian. Why does he wear black all the time?#$e#I don't get it." 
"Hey, the gridball game is on today!#e#This might be my favorite day of the week." 
"You came all the way through the snow to see me?#$e#That's nice of you.$h" 
"I guess it's interesting that some people are totally different than us, you know?#$b#I don't always understand why others act the way they do, but that's fine." 
"Hey, @. Could you do me a favor?$l#$b#If you see Haley, tell her I'm busy.$l#$e#Thanks." 
"I'll admit... I was a little jealous when you and Haley got married. But, hey... It's a chance for me to learn something new about myself.$9" 
"You know what? I'm going to start reading a book!" 
"I wish I could control the weather." 
"If I ever make a lot of money, I'll make sure all my friends and family are taken care of.#$e#That means you, too.$h" 

"With all this space, I can really achieve a full body workout." 
"I never had many friends in town... I sometimes wonder how I'd end up if you never moved here.$9" 
"Aw... I was gonna do some jogging outside. But I can't really do it in this weather." 
"*grumble*... I just woke up and I'm hungry for some protein.$9" 
"I think I might start reading books. I don't want to become stagnant now that I'm a married guy!" 
"Unghh... one... Unghhh... two... It feels great to lift weights outdoors!$6" 
"Hey, did you have a good day? I'm sure tomorrow will be even better.$h" 
"How's it going? I've been carrying the old gridball around with me all day. A guy can pretend...$u" 
"Oh... the smell? I've been eating garlic all day. I'm trying to stay manly... Sorry.$l" 
"I've been setting aside a few scraps for Dusty. He deserves a treat now and then." 
"I was hungry so I made some dinner. Here, I saved you a plate. [241 242 225 214 198]$h" 
"Ahh... there's nothing like a good night's sleep next to my husband!$h^Ahh... there's nothing like a good night's sleep next to my wife!$h" 
"Hey, honey! I made you a hot breakfast.[195 210 211]#$e#If you want to get strong, you have to eat like you mean it!" 
"Come here. *squeeze*... Mmhmm. You're firming up from all that farm work." 
"I'm still getting used to cooking and doing laundry... It's not exactly my favorite, but I knew what I was getting into when I married you.$h" 
"There's a couple things around the house that I'm going to try and fix today. Don't worry about me, I'm not bored." 
"It feels good to push yourself to the limit, doesn't it? You'll really feel like you earned your place in the soft bed tonight." 
"Did you get a haircut or something? You're looking pretty good today. Maybe it's all that fresh air...$l" 
"Tell me all about your day. It's good to get everything off your chest now and then." 
"Hey... I got some new shorts. I thought you might be interested to know...$l" 
"If you need some quiet time to yourself, that's okay with me." 
"Hey. When I stand here and look out over our land... I'm really proud. You've done great work." 
"This is a great place to raise children. I would've loved growing up in a place like this. So much room to run around!" 
"I like to spend as much time outside as possible. It just feels better to be out here." 
"Look at us, with our little farm. We make a cute couple.$h^Hey. Maybe it's the golden light, but you look beautiful today.$l" 
"Ahh... It feels great to be outside. Stardew Valley really is the most beautiful place..." 
"I'm still getting used to my new life as a stay-at-home dad.$h" 
"Little 1 is going to grow up strong, just like Daddy." 
"I wonder what it's like to be pregnant...?$h" 
"Maybe 2 will be the first professional gridball player from Pelican Town?$h" 
"I finally have the family life that I missed out on as a kid... thank you.$l" 
"@... I will always love you.$l" 
"You're very handsome... have I told you that?$l^You're very beautiful... have I told you that?$l" 
"I know you're strong, but sometimes I worry that you might get eaten by slimes... or worse. Just be careful.$9" 
"I'm going into town today. I'll see you tonight." 
"I had a good day. I like to see my grandparents often, they're getting pretty old." 
"Finally, the snow has melted and the sun is back! My body feels great.$h" 
"I wonder if a powder of stardrop would help me bulk up..." 
"Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? I guess it'll be good to load up on the free eggs." 
"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I better do some extra push-ups tonight.$9#$e#Those jumpsuits are pretty tight... and everyone's going to be watching closely." 
"Summer's a very energetic time of year, and body feels it too! I feel solid." 
"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?#$e#I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!$h" 
"Aw... summer's almost gone. My muscles are starting to deflate...$s" 
"Well, summer's over... but I'm going to stay positive. The warmer seasons will always return." 
"Tomorrow's the fair, are we going to go?#$e#I don't care one way or another." 
"I hope my grandparents are doing okay. Grandpa's too cheap to turn on the furnace until the last minute." 
"Make sure you stay warm this winter. I worry about your delicate skin." 
"Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow? I think you can win it!" 
"It's been a great year, @. I'm looking forward to next year! Now, come closer... $l" 

"I'm just catching up with some old friends... you go on and have a good time."
"I played the 'Strength' game too many times and now my arms feel like rubber."
"There's something weird over there. But how do I get to it?#$e#There's gotta be a secret passage somewhere around here."
"Ungh... I think I ate a dozen too many hard boiled eggs...$s"
"I try to eat at least three eggs every day.#$e#I need that protein for my legs."
"I wonder what would happen to my arms and legs if I ate thirty eggs a day?"
"I'm just enjoying the scenery... hehe."
"Hey, I'll take any excuse to come hang out at the beach. This weather is amazing!"
"Perfect weather for a beach party, huh?"
"I can't believe summer's over... I feel like it just started.$s"
"What am I thankful for? I'll show you when we get back home...$l"
"Oh, hello.$s"
"I'll be rooting for you in the fishing competition."
"Snowmen are okay, I guess. But mostly I'm looking forward to the spring."
