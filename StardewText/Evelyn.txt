"Why, hello and welcome to our little community, dear! #$b#You can call me 'Granny' if you like.$h" 
"Oh, I'm sure George would be interested in that!" 
"That's a very pretty rose, dear. Have you shown it to Emily? It makes me think of her." 
"Oh, sweetie... that was so nice of you to put Pam up in a beautiful new house!$h#$e#It warms my heart when people take care of each other like that..." 
"Call me a silly old fool... but I think I have an idea who paid for Pam's new house... *wink*" 
"Oh my! That's so kind of you, dear. Why yes... I'd love to go to the movies!$h#$b#You go on ahead, and I'll meet you at the theater." 
"Oh my! What a lovely day.$u" 
"Since you're so interested in my husband I'll let you in on a little secret: he really likes leeks! You can find them in the mountains this time of year." 
"I saw the most beautiful family of butterflies sunning themselves in the town garden yesterday.$k#$e#The good Mayor put me in charge of the town's public gardens.#$e#I've been working on the town flower beds for weeks, so don't step on them!" 
"I'll be baking cookies today. I like to make flower shapes in the spring.$h#$e#Maybe I'll tell you my recipe one of these days." 
"George spends the whole day in front of that darned television set.#$e#I wish he'd go outside more. Some fresh air would do him good." 
"I used to love looking at the clouds, but I have trouble seeing them these days.#$e# My eyes just don't work as well as they used to.$s" 
"It's nice to be so close to the ocean. The sound of the sea makes going to sleep a lot easier.#$e#As kids we hunted for seashells after the tide went out. Those were the days..." 
"It's nice of you to take the time to visit George and I.#$e#Without young people around, we'd age much faster.$h" 
"Thank you!$h" 
"What was that, dear? I could've sworn you said 'hockey puck'. *sigh* My ears aren't what they used to be.$s" 
"I feel more energetic in this wonderful weather.$u" 
"How's my grandson doing? I imagine he's quite happy living on the farm.#$e#He deserves to be happy... he's a good boy." 
"George is always a little less grumpy in the summer. The warm weather softens his bones.#$e#You might not be able to tell, but I can. I've known him for sixty years!" 
"The good Mayor put me in charge of the town's public gardens.#$e#I've been working on the town flower beds for months, so don't step on them!" 
"I'm going to bake cookies today. They're coconut wonders shaped like little palm trees! Heehee.$h#$e#Maybe I'll tell you my recipe one of these days." 
"Be careful out there, dear. You could get sunburnt!" 
"Sweet peas are in bloom right now.#$e#They've got such a wonderful fragrance, haven't they?" 
"It seems like we always have more visitors when I start baking cookies.#$e#My mother taught me the recipe." 
"With every year I appreciate the seasons more and more. For young people it's easy to let them slip by." 
"I've been putting raisins in George's oatmeal... but he hasn't said a word. I wonder if he even notices these things?" 
"The good Mayor put me in charge of the town's public gardens.#$e#The fall flowers are delicate, so don't go stomping on them! I know how you kids like to do." 
"Today I'm baking cookies. They're shaped like little pumpkins.$h#$e#Maybe I'll tell you my recipe one of these days." 
"Are you friends with Alex?#$e#Sometime he worries me sick." 
"Oh, hello my dear. I think of you as my own grandson now.$h^Oh, hello my dear. I think of you as my own grand-daughter now.$h" 
"My eyesight may be poor, but my nose hasn't failed me yet!#$e#I can smell fallen leaves and mushrooms. It reminds me of the forests I used to play in as a girl." 
"Be careful you don't slip on the ice, dear." 
"Aren't you cold? You should wear a thicker jacket, my dear!#$e#This weather isn't good for my joints...$s" 
"I usually tend to the gardens, but they're covered in snow.#$e#I still like to check up on them now and then." 
"We've lived here for over 30 years.#$e#We've seen a lot of people come and go. Your grandfather, for one. Bless him... *sigh*" 
"Oh... my dear. You have your grandfather's eyes...$s#$e#Yes... yes... I knew him very well." 
"You should make some hot soup to stay warm.#$e#And make sure you wear a jacket!" 
"@, have I told you that George and I have lived in our house for 30 years?#$e#I hope you stay here for a while.$h" 

"I wish Gus would include a vegetarian option. Some zucchini skewers, maybe?"
"This festival has been a tradition for as long as I can remember.#$b#Tradition connects us with both the past and the future... it's comforting."
"$y 'Do you have hens on your farm? Oh, good! I'm sure they lay the most delicious eggs... Spring would be a great time to start raising chickens, don't you think?"
"I've been working on these floral arrangements for a week. Do you like them?"
"Ahh... The smell of the ocean takes me back many years. Long before you were born."
"I remember seeing the jellies once, as a little girl. Oh, how I jumped with joy when they arrived!#$e#But that was long ago... I'm a lot less energetic now."
"Oh, my! Aren't you cold, dear? It's freezing!"
"Did I ever tell you how George and I first met? He actually pelted me with a snowball in this very festival.#$e#He was a gentleman back then, and came over to see if I was okay.$h"

"*gasp*... This is absolutely marvelous!$u#$e#You've made an old lady very happy./72 220 239 284 591 595/Oh my, it looks wonderful! That's very kind of you./-6 18 402 418/Um, Where will I put this?/16 80/...it smells awful./225 226 227 228 219 396 397 393 372 248 296 -4 330/How nice. Thank you, dear.//"

"Hello there, dear,  I hope your farm is doing well.^ I'm sending you a little something from my kitchen... I hope it didn't crumble in the mail.
"Dear @,^I usually don't give out my recipes... but since you've been such a sweetheart to George and I, I've written this one down for you.
"Hello, dear...^^I know you're just getting started as a gardener, so I wanted to give you a little tip.^^Most crops only grow in one season. When summer arrives, your spring crops will all die out. So plan ahead!
"Dear @,^I'd like to surprise my husband with a gift. He's a big fan of leeks. Could you bring me one?
"Dear @,^^Thank you so much for the leeks. They look fresh and delicious. George will love them.^^Today, I'm going to surprise him with 12 little gift-wrapped treasures (thanks to you!). Stop by if you want to be there!^^P.S. Please accept this gift. I think you'll enjoy it!
"When I woke up I heard dripping from somewhere... I think the roof might be leaking.$s#$e#In the old days, George would've scampered right up and fixed it... *sigh*$s"

"Good morning, dear.\"
"It was a lovely walk out here... I haven't seen this old farm in a long time.$s#$b#It looks even better than I remember!$h\"
"Here, I brought you a little something.#$b#It's a gift... from one gardener to another.$h\"
"These pots are really handy. You can use them to grow crops of any season indoors!#$b#They also look nice outside... but out here they can only house in-season crops.\"
"If you need more, they're really easy to make, too... here, I've got an old magazine clipping with instructions.\"
"Well, I'd better go. George gets grumpy if he doesn't have his oatmeal on time...#$b#You have a great day, honey!$h\"

"Oh! @! You're wondering what that good smell is?#$b#Why, that's nice of you to say! I'm actually baking my famous cookies!$h\"
"Here, why don't you try one?\"
Well, what do you think?
"I think I've come to know you well enough to give you my recipe. Just make sure to keep it a secret.$h\"

“Could you check his lungs? He's been wheezing lately.”
