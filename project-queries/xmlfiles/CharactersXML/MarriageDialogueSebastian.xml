<p><context>Rainy_Day_1:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"Hey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell...#$e#I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Rainy_Day_2:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"Hey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this... want it?[575 769 767 84 66 78]#$e#I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you.$7"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Rainy_Night_2:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"Sorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something.#$e#I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores..."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Indoor_Day_0:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy.#$e#The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Indoor_Night_0:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"Hey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting...#$e#...#$e#The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Indoor_Night_1:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"Maybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired.#$e#I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes.$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Indoor_Night_2:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"It's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time.#$e#I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Indoor_Night_3:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Outdoor_3:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"I don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out?#$e#Just an idea...$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Outdoor_4:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"We should raise more slimes... In big quantities they can be pretty profitable. And they're so easy to raise.#$e#Also, different colored slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>OneKid_0:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of %kid1! It's just... something new."</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>TwoKids_2:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"I've had this recurring dream that %kid2 is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>TwoKids_3:</context> <dialogue who="Sebastian">"We've come a long way, @. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation.#$e#Now that I'm here, I like it...$l"</dialogue> </p>
