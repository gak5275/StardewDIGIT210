<p><context>Indoor_Day_2:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"I'm happy here, in the house. I like to spend all my time in a good spot... I don't need to \"get out\" like humans do. But I understand that you need to! Please don't feel like you have to stay here with me."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Indoor_Day_3:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"I'm considering spending my day all balled up and wedged in the corner... What? You mean you don't do that?"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>Indoor_Night_3:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"Sometimes I pause and think of all that I've learned about humans from you... I wish all my fellow shadow people could know this feeling."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Indoor_Night_4:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"I want to be a good housemate for you, but I never know if I'm doing well... *groan*  I have a hard time understanding human expression. B... but... you're happy living with me? Okay!"</dialogue> </p>

<p><context>TwoKids_3:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"This house has been blessed with two children, now... Does that mean Yoba approves of our unconventional living arrangement?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Good_1:</context> <dialogue who="Krobus">"I feel a sensation in my body... is this... 'platonic love'? ... Oh, wait... I'm just shedding my skin."</dialogue> </p>
