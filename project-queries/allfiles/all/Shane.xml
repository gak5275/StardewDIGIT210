<p><context>Mon:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I don't know you. Why are you talking to me?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Entering:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Buh... hope the bar's open."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Leaving:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Welp... got my year's supply of Vitamin D. Now I can play video games with the blinds shut the rest of the year."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Shore:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"That's right... I'm not wearing any shoes or socks. Some call it a public health risk. The crabs seem to enjoy it, though."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Chair:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Hoo... Feels good to rest these hams. If anyone needs me, I'll just be sitting here, marinating."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Bar:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Phew... feels good to have a cold drink... Or maybe a few..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Okay, this sand is piping hot. I regret not wearing shoes."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>danceRejection:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"...No."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>pamHouseUpgrade:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I heard you built Pam a house... That's really generous... You know, I could use a hundred thousand gold myself... *ahem* ...ah ...Just kidding. ...Heh."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>pamHouseUpgradeAnonymous:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I heard someone bought Pam a house... *sigh*... What did Pam ever do to earn that kind of generosity??"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>divorced:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"... ...Leave me alone."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>breakUp:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"*gulp* Oh... Yeah, okay... I guess I should've seen this coming. I'll... uh... guess I'll see you at the Saloon."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>secondChance_Guys:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I don't understand you... *sigh*..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Mon2:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I hardly know you. Why are you talking to me?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Mon4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Hey. Sorry if I came off as rude when we first met. It takes me a while to warm up to strangers."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Mon10:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Do you ever feel like the whole world is scrutinizing you like some disgusting insect?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"What? What do you want? Go away."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue2:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"What do you want from me? Money? I'd give you a pot of gold to leave me alone!"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Every time I try something new it goes horribly wrong. You learn to just stay in a shell."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue6:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Life isn't so bad... at least I have frozen pizza and eggs."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"No, I don't have time to chat with you."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed8:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I guess I've grown attached to Marnie and Jas. We're a ragtag bunch but it kind of feels like a weird family. I never really had much of a family as a kid."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"*sigh* ...Every day is the same. Stocking those horrible shelves, going to the saloon, tossing and turning all night. I hated my job at JojaMart, but now that I'm unemployed I feel even worse."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"What do you want? Leave me alone."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"You're really persistent. I guess I'm just surprised that anyone would be interested in talking to me."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu6:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu8:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"You like talking to me? I guess I believe you... maybe you're as weird as I am."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Don't you have work to do?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"What's the point of life if all you do is work? I haven't been able to pay my rent, but Marnie's letting me stay anyway. I'm lucky."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri6:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I'll definitely be going to the saloon tonight. What else is there to do?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Why are you bothering me? I want to be alone."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat2:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I'm surprised that you're still trying to make friends with me. Haven't I been rude enough to you yet? *sigh*..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain. If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat8:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I've really grown attached to Marnie's chickens."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I'm busy, can't you tell?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun6:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"...I think I might be gaining weight."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun8:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"If I watch more TV maybe I can forget about life. That would be relaxing."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun10:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Hi, @. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun4:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Hmm... it's . Should I throw a frozen pizza in the microwave, or should I wait?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun2:</context> <dialogue who="Shane">"You again? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_room1:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Okay... that'll require a great script. Maybe I'll ask Elliott for advice next time I see him at the saloon."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_room2:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Sounds great. I'll have to create a bunch of practical effects to make it look cool."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_noLoan1:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I didn't know you were such a miser..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_noLoan2:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Okay, Dad... Okay, Mom..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_noLoan3:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Oh, wow..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_apologize1:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"...Yeah, me too."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_apologize2:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"I know... that's why I stopped by, to tell you about it."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_apologize3:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_stadium1:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense. Me? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes. But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context><event>event_stadium2:</event></context> <dialogue who="Shane">"Oh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city? I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know."</dialogue> </p>
