"Ahoy there! It's nice to see young folk movin' in to the valley. It's not very common these days." 
"Ah... That's the perfect bait for a catfish I've been tryin' to catch!#$b#Here, let me trade you this for it. I'm not sure what it is, but it washed up on the beach not too long ago.#$b#Somethin' tells me you could use it, lad.^Somethin' tells me you could use it, miss." 
"*sniff*... Ah... That old familiar scent. You've been raisin' crabs, haven't ya?#$b#Yer a man after me own heart, @. Hah!$h^Yer a lady after me own heart, @. Hah!$h#$b#Here, take this. I found it on the beach... Been savin' it fer a special occasion. It's not every day I discover a fellow crab enthusiast! [797]" 
"Ah... a movie. That's kind of ye, lad.^Ah... a movie. That's kind of ye, miss.#$b#I'll just finish me pipe, and head over." 
"Ahoy there, son.^Ahoy there, lass.#$b#Looks like decent weather for fishing, eh?" 
"Have you had much luck in the local waters? You look like you could be a strong angler if you set your mind to it." 
"A true angler has respect for the water... don't you forget that." 
"The ol' Man was a fisherman, you know. I grew up sailing between the fern islands, living from catch to catch.#$e#The fishing life is tough, but there's something about it that keeps you goin'." 
"Some fish come and go with the seasons. Others only come out at night or in the rain." 
"*mumble* *mumble* ...Eh? I would tell you about my thoughts, but it's a fisherman's secret." 
"There's rumors of some very rare fish in these parts... but only an experienced angler could stand a chance against them.#$e#You'll need the finest bait you can get if you want a rare fish to bite." 
"If you really want to get the fish biting, make sure you put some bait on your hook." 
"If the local fishing scene got a bit more lively, I might expand the shop's stock." 
"How's the fishing life going for ya?#$e#I try to fish as often as possible, but it's not easy when you've got a shop to run." 
"If you purchase a high quality fishing rod, you'll be able to attach bait and tackle to the line.#$b#Bait causes fish to bite faster. Tackle can make your job a lot easier when reeling fish in.#$e#There's all kinds of tackle, with different perks. They're usually a little flimsy, so don't be surprised if your tackle breaks after a while." 
"Hey, it's my skipper, @!$h#$e#I'd give you a discount on bait if I could afford it.$s" 

"Are you setting up a grange display, @? It's your chance to show off all the good produce from %!"
"Sometimes I'll hide an egg too well and no one finds it...#$b#Well, until summer rolls around. Then the hot air starts to bring out the rotten smell... Hehe. $h"
"Aye... on rainy days, you'll find catfish in these waters. They're a challenging catch, but well worth the effort!"
"I should've brought my fishing pole."
"Hi there, @. Taking a breather?#$e#To tell you the truth, I'd rather be fishing right now."
"Most night-fish would be scared of the light... these are strange ones."
"$y 'Do you want to hear the Legend of the Winter Star?__In the night sky of winter, there is a bright star only visible from this valley. No one knows why this is... but in times of old people would come from far and wide to see it.*They believed that anyone who laid eyes on the Winter Star would be blessed with good fortune. Some even claim that the mysterious fruit known as =Stardrop is connected to the Winter Star in some way.__Suit yourself.'"
"$y 'Hey, @. Ready for some ice fishing?__That's the spirit!$h__We'll see.$h__Well, then think of it as good practice!$h'"

"Ahoy... you know that {2} you sold me the other day? Well, I sizzled it up in me cabin last night...#$b#T'was the mealiest fish I've ever set me gums on...$s"
"Ahoy! Remember that {2} you brought in the other day? Well, I sizzled it up in me cabin last night...#$b#T'was the finest fish I've had since I was a wee lad!$h"

"Are you okay? I found you washed up on the shore, lad.$s^miss.$s#$b#You really had me worried... I thought you were a goner! Be a little more careful out there...$s#$b#The island can be a dangerous place."

"She looks good as new!"
"Sorry if I smell like fish, heh!"
"Ahoy!"

"This is great! If only me ol' Pappy was around. He'd go nuts for this./72 143 149 154 276 337 698 459/This looks great. Thank you!/66 336 340 699 707 198 202 209 212 213 214 219 225 727 730 728 732 265/Hmmm... You like stuff like this? Huh./-7 -81 2 4 330/... *sniff*... Well I guess I can toss it into the chum bucket.//A gift! Thanks./-4 227 228 242/"

"Dear @,^I'd like to share an ol' cooking recipe my pappy used to make. It's important the fish is FRESH.
"Dear @,^ Your angling skills surpass even my ol' Pappy's... I'm impressed. ^ This stardrop's been passed down from Willy Sr. to Willy Jr. for... oh, heck. Prob'ly a thousand years.^Seein' as I don't have any kids... I want you to have it.

"Hey, I've got a little challenge for you:^    Catch me a squid.^You can fish them from the ocean at night. They only show up in the winter, though.

"As a way of saying 'thanks', I wanted to teach you an old fisherman's secret... My ol' Pappy taught me this on a fishing trip many years ago.\"
"Using that bobber will attract higher quality fish.#$b#That means more money in yer pocket, lad^lass. Hehe...$h
"Got one!\"

"Aye... a sad sight, isn't she?\"
"She was me father's boat... Served him well for over 50 years.#$b#But now she can barely stay afloat.$s\"
"I'd repair her myself, but I don't have the right materials, lad.^miss.
"Aye... 200 pieces of hardwood to patch the hull would be a good start.#$b#But we'll also need to get the ticket machine back up, and the iridium anchor repaired.\"
"If I could get me hands on the right materials, and repair the ol' girl... well, then I could take you to the Fern Islands.\"
"Volcanic islands full of strange parrots, they say...\"
"Aye... I thought you would, lad.^miss.
"I'll leave this door unlocked for ya... you can come drop off the materials whenever you like.\"
"Alright, suit yourself...$s#$b#If you have a change of heart, you can always come back and help out. I'll leave this door unlocked, anyhow.\"

"Not the fishin' type, eh? That's too bad...$s\"
"Yes, it's a difficult sport... especially for a beginner.#$b#Have you tried the 'Training Rod'? I sell them right here, at a very low price.#$b#You should try using a 'Training Rod' until you get a little more experienced.\"
"Aye... well, business has been tough, lately.$s#$b#It all started about the same time that old community center fell to ruin... me fish just don't sell like they used to...#$b#I've been working double-time just to make ends meet!\"
"No time for me own projects...$s#$b#But, if things picked back up around here, I might have the time to show ya somethin'...\"

"Some day, lad^miss... you'll see what I mean.

"Go on, Linus... tell him.\"

"What do you think, @?\"

"Poor lad...$s\"
"I wonder if there's some way to help...$s\"

"Hi, @.\"
"It's odd... I'm not sure what caused this boulder to disappear.\"
"This stream is flowing from deep within the mountain.\"
"Hey! Do you see that glistening in the water?\"
"Yes... that's quality ore!$h\"
"The flow of water must be carrying it out of the mountain.\"
"You know what this means, right?\"
"It means we can start panning for ore!$h\"
"Here, I've got an extra pan in my backpack... why don't you take it?\"
"If you ever see ore glistening in the water, use that pan and see what you find.\"

"Got one, lad!\"

"Hmm...\"
"The mushrooms are a tad chewier than last year...\"
"Aye, lad\"

"Me?\"
"Hehe... That I do. We showed up one morning and the place was crawlin' with 'em.$h\"
