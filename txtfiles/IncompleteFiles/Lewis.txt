"So, how was your first night in the old cottage?#$e#Your grandpa used to complain about the rickety old bed. But I think, deep down, he actually loved that house." 
"I'm impressed, @. You've really fixed up the place!$h" 
"Everyone aboard! We're heading back to the valley!" 
"Vacation opportunities like this could really expand the local economy!#$e#I'd better not stay in the sun too long, or my moustache will dry out." 
"Hehe... look at this place! I don't know how you did it, but this little vacation spot is the talk of the town.$h" 
"Hehe... Gus is really in his element." 
"@, I heard what you did for Pam and Penny... now *that's* the kind of community support I love to see in Pelican Town!$h" 
"@, did you hear? Someone paid Robin to build Pam and Penny a house! Robin won't tell me who it was, though.#$e#Regardless of who paid, I love seeing this kind of community support in Pelican Town!$h" 
"*sniff*... *sniff*... can you smell that? I've been catching hints of fresh crab all day...$u" 
"*sniff*... *sniff*... Ah, I sense you've been spending some time in the old Community Center. It's good to know someone's taking care of the place." 
"I've never felt such an overwhelming pride in our community. You've done Pelican Town a great service, @.$h" 
"@, did you hear? It seems the old town bus started working again overnight!$h#$b#That old thing has been dormant for decades... This is truly a great mystery." 
"So, the old Community Center is gone... I guess times change, and good things come and go... Yet I can't help but feel a sense of loss.$s#$e#I just hope this doesn't mar my record as Mayor.$s" 
"It's a good season to start thinking about gardening, even for us non-farmers.#$e# The valley is known for producing some of the finest spring flowers!$h" 
"Just place anything you want to sell in the shipping box next to your house.#$e#I'll be interested in seeing what kinds of things you put in there." 
"Hi, Gus!" 
"At the start of each season you'll have to remove the previous season's dead crops. It's easiest with a scythe." 
"Have you planted any spring crops yet? The season doesn't last forever, you know." 
"#$c .3#You're in town early, huh? Finished with your farm chores already?#$e#Good morning! I'm just checking on the garden as usual.$h#$c .5#Hmm... are these aphids?$s#$e#Hmm... I hope these aren't scale bugs...$s" 
"Hmm... tax collection... *mumble* ...spring festivities expenses... *mumble*...$u#$e#Yes?" 
"Ah... There's nothing like a strong cup of tea in the morning." 
"The saloon can get pretty lively at night. Sometimes we even put a coin in the jukebox *chuckle*$h#$e#I like to visit once a week or so to catch up on things, anyway." 
"Good evening! It's nice to see you socializing with the townsfolk.#$b#It's good to stop by once in a while and see what the latest news is.$h" 
"Good evening, @! I'm glad to see you relaxing at the saloon. It's good for you to take a break now and then.$h#$b#Your grandfather always worked himself too hard... I'll have an extra beer in his honor tonight." 
"I hope things are going well on  farm. I'd hate to see it all dried up." 
"Everyone seems a little happier on the weekends, don't you think?#$e#I'm on the job seven days a week, though." 
"I've been Mayor of Pelican Town for over twenty years!#$e#No one ever runs against me when it's time for an election. I like to think that it means I'm doing my job well.#$e#I like being Mayor." 
"Thank you @. I won't forget this." 
"*sob* ... I can't believe you would do that...$s#$b#You're terrible.$s" 
"Gardening is a hobby of mine, so I'm excited for this warm weather." 
"#$c .3#Ah, my flowers are growing wonderfully!$h#$c .3#Good morning! Can you smell the sweet scent of these dew-lilies?#$e#It's early but the air is already quite warm. Summer is nice for an old guy like me hehe." 
"How did I become Mayor in the first place? It's a long story.#$e#We're both too busy for stories right now." 
"The moonlight jellies will be here soon. It's one of my favorite things about the valley." 
"The saloon gets pretty lively at night.#$e#I like to visit once a week or so to catch up on things. And to get a taste of Gus' authentic spaghetti." 
"Hmm... I wonder if it's anyone's birthday today? I'd better check the calendar by Pierre's shop." 
"Everyone seems a little happier on the weekends, don't you think?#$e#I'm on the job seven days a week, though." 
"Say, are you growing any blueberries on your farm?#$e#I do enjoy a fresh blueberry." 
"Some of the townsfolk are wary of strangers. You'll have to win their trust before they open up to you.#$e#Just be persistent and you'll get through to them.$h" 
"It was around this time of year when I first became Mayor, over twenty years ago.#$e#That makes me feel really old.$s" 
"If you have any suggestions for the town, just drop a note into my suggestion box.#$e#Oh, that's right... I don't have a suggestion box." 
"Every Wednesday I have buckwheat waffles and coffee for breakfast. It's a little tradition I keep to keep the bachelor life interesting.$h" 
"#$c .3#Hmmm... these strange little mushrooms have been popping up in my wood chips. I wonder what kind they are?#$c .3#Good morning! We're slowly entering the cold months, so I'm seeing my garden to a gentle end.#$e#Ah, you're in town early, huh? Finished with your farm chores already?" 
"The saloon gets pretty lively at night.#$e#I like to visit once a week or so to catch up on things." 
"I hope things are going well for you on the farm." 
"Do you have any bee houses on your farm?#$e#If you place them near flowers you can get different types of honey." 
"Sometimes you can tell if there's something buried underground. Just keep your eyes open." 
"Have you tried Gus' 'secret' spaghetti sauce?$s#$b#...The ingredients may be secret, but the smell isn't.#$b#I'll see you later." 
"Are you doing your best on the farm, @? You'll have to accomplish things in many areas if you want to become a well-rounded citizen." 
"Well, winter is here! That means the townspeople will be spending most of their days indoors.#$e#At least you'll know where to find them!$h" 
"Another year is almost over!#$e#I hope you had a productive year!" 
"I've got to start coming up with a plan for improving our town next year!" 
"I'll still come by every night to collect your produce, even in the snow.#$e#You still need to make money in the winter!" 
"I hope things are going well for you on the farm." 
"I've never been married. I have no family. All I live for is to be Mayor.$s#$e#Is it worth it?$s#$e#...*sigh*...$s" 
"Hi there, @! How're you doing today?$h#$e#If you see Marnie, tell her I say 'hi'."
