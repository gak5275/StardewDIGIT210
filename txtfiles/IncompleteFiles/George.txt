"Hmmph... It's irritating to have to meet all these new people, huh?#$b#Name's George, by the way. Now buzz off... Hmmph." 
"What's this?#$b#Hmmph... so you push this button first? What's this button do? Hmmph... *grumble*#$b#Hehe! Well, how about that! It's a new channel!$h#$b#Here, take this. It's a stone I found when I was a coal miner back in the day. Funny thing, it's glowed blue and stayed cold for over forty years. Like magic!" 
"Thanks for replacing that beat up old trailer... the new house is much nicer to look at.#$e#You know, I'll bet it increases the value of our property too!" 
"Welp... that new house blocks my view of the river a little... but it sure looks nicer than that old tin can Pam was livin' in." 
"You wanna see a movie with an old geezer like me? ...Well... okay. I'll meet you there." 
"So... the old Community Center is gone, huh? Whatever happened to small-town values? It's a shame how times have changed..." 
"I'm not much of a talker. Especially not to strangers, if you don't mind me saying." 
"Hmmph... Looks like another gloomy day.$s" 
"Alex is my grandson. Have I told you that already?#$e#Huh? Speak up." 
"How can two men get married? It's unnatural... Hmmph. I guess I'm just \"old fashioned\"...^You're part of the family, now. I'm glad that my grandson found such a nice wife." 
"I'll admit, I thought it was... strange... for two men to be together. But you're such a nice young man, and I know you two are in love... I've changed my mind.^You're part of the family, now... and I couldn't be more proud." 
"I can't talk right now, young man.^I can't talk right now, miss.#$e#My favorite program is on." 
"So you're a farmer, huh? At least it's honest work." 
"The weekend is no different than any other time, for me.#$e#That's how it is when you're retired." 
"Aren't you cold? They don't make sweaters like they used to.#$e#*Sigh*" 
"I'm surprised you want to be friends with an old-timer like me." 
"Hello, @. Wanna watch the TV with me?" 
"My grand-pap was a farmer. It's a respectable profession.#$e#If I wasn't so darned old I'd come to your farm and show you a thing or two..." 
"I wish my legs worked so I could play catch with Alex.$s#$e#That'll never happen.$s" 
"I've been thinking...Maybe I've been a little bit of a grouch.$s#$e#I used to think no one cared about us old folks." 
"You know, I really have been a grumpy old man to everyone. But now I feel like I'm softening up like an old ripe fruit. Hehe!$h#$e#Take care, son.^Take care, hun." 
"@! Let me turn off this darned television and we can have a little chat.$h#$e#So what are the young people doing these days?" 
"You know, I shouldn't get too depressed about my legs.#$e#I should just be happy that I'm alive.$h" 
"When you get as old as me it's a lot harder to adjust to new things.#$e#One day you'll know what I mean.#$e#Go on, enjoy yourself while you're still young." 
"Ohh... It's so cold.#$e#When you're young the cold doesn't bite as hard." 

"Hmm... smoked turkey haunch? I guess this festival isn't all bad.$h"
"What's everyone so happy about? Hmmph...#$b#Eggs... why eggs?"
"Evelyn made eggs and leeks for breakfast, so I'm in a good mood.$h"
"Flowers? I can hardly see them.#$e#It's too bright out here!"
"That music! It's too loud.#$b#Can't I have a little peace and quiet to enjoy the ocean?"
"What, why are you looking at me like that? You think I'm too old to enjoy something like this?"
"A feast for some stupid star? Humbug!"
"Hmmph... Wife dragged me out into the cold for this?"

"This is my favorite thing! Thank you./20 205/Thanks./18 195 199 200 214 219 223 231 233/That's a terrible gift./-80 16/This is probably the worst gift I've ever seen. Thanks a lot./22 80 330/A gift? Hmm...#$e#Do you want something in return?//"

"Found some good quality stone. ^Maybe you can build with it or something.
"Figured I'd give you this recipe I had laying around. Try not to burn it.
"To Farmer @:^My knee's acting up again, and you know what helps? ^Rubbing the darn thing with hot pepper.^ Trouble is, my supply's run dry. If you've got one to spare I'd be much obliged.
"It's awful cold, isn't it? What a rotten day."

"Ha! Good stuff!\"
"Get him!\"

"Nnnnggghh....I just can't reach it!$u#$b#If only I could get up from this infernal chair...$s\"
"Thanks, young man.^Thanks, miss.\"
"*sigh*...It happened 30 years ago.$s#$b#I was working in the coal mines. We were near the end of our shift, but there was one last seam that needed to be broken up.#$b#I went in there aiming to set off a stick of dynamite, but my foot slipped into a crack and I dropped it. The dynamite exploded on impact.\"
"The next thing I remember, I was laying in the hospital... and they told me I'd never walk again.\"
"So there you have it. You probably figured I was just too old to walk.#$b#Well I'll have you know that I'd be spryer than a spring chicken if I hadn't been in that accident!\"
"...\"
"You've been very nice to me, young man. I appreciate that.^You've been really nice to me, miss. I appreciate it.#$b#When you're old, you start to forget that anyone cares about you.\"

"Hmmph... I know what's best for me. Who do you think you are, telling me how to live my life?\"
"Not so fast! I'd like to get a second opinion from this young man.^lady
"Fine. I'll do what you say, doctor.\"

"@? What's the meaning of all this...#$b#Is this some kind of prank?\"
"Leek... $s\"
"My favorite... Just like Mama used to make, so many years ago...\"
"Hmmph. Well...\"
"Well... That... Hmmph.#$b#I guess maybe I'm not as forgotten and ignored as I thought...$s\"
"Thanks, son.$h^Thanks, hun.$h#$b#You made an old man's day.$h\"
"Hah! She thought she could fool me!\"
"She thought she could fool me... into thinking I'm anything more than an inconvenience.$s\"
"Well, I know better...\"
"Now, scram!$u\"
"Hah! You're a prankster, then?\"
"Hahah... You know, I was a bit of a prankster back in the day, too.$h\"
"Well, at least you gave me a laugh.$h\"
"What, you think I'm going to open them?\"
"Hah! Not a chance. You think I'd fall for the old 'exploding present' gag?\"
"These are going straight into the trash!\"

"Score!\"
"Atta boy!\"
"You did good, son. I could watch this at home, but coming here makes me feel young again!$h\"

"*Sigh*... How am I going to reach that letter in the back?$s\"
"Hmmph. I could've done it myself! And I can certainly move around on my own!$u#$b#How feeble do you think I am?\"
"*sigh*...No, no... I'm sorry, miss. I shouldn't have gotten so angry.$s\"
"It was actually very kind of you to help me out.\"

"The good ol' days.\"
"I've lived here too long to see this town go to ruin.#$b#You can count me in!$h\"

"Grr... sounds like those raccoons are back again. Filthy varmints...\"
"Ah, you turned up at the right moment, son.^miss.#$b#Could you do an old man a favor? Could you go around the corner and scare off those raccoons for me? They've been causin' a real mess.#$b#Thanks. Make sure you give 'em a good scare so they never come back.\"

"What's the money for, anyway? You buyin' a new purse?\"

“I'm just here for the free coffee.”

“Well how much longer do I have, Doc?”

“I've never been religious, But hey... I'm old”
