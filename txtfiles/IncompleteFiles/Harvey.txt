"It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Harvey, the local doctor.#$e#I perform regular check-ups and medical procedures for all the residents of Pelican Town. It's rewarding work.#$e#I hope you'll find your own work equally rewarding, in time.$h" 
"Sunscreen? Check...#$b#Sun hat? Check..." 
"If you get burnt, a little aloe vera cream might help soothe the skin." 
"I combed the whole beach for glass. We wouldn't want anyone to get a cut on their foot!" 
"It's nice to have an opportunity to relax now and then.#$b#The trouble is actually letting go of your worries...$s" 
"It's important to stay hydrated in this heat. I'm going to ask Gus if he has any coconut water!$h" 
"I'll let you in on a little secret... I can only swim with floaties.$s" 
"Oh! I'm sorry... I, er... have plans to ask someone else.$s" 
"I... I can't look at you. Please spare me any more pain.$s" 
"...Y...You...?$s#$b#*gulp*... I... I think I'm going to be sick...$s" 
"I'm busy with my work. I can't speak to you.$s" 
"I want you back in my life, @. I'm willing to forget what happened.$s" 
"We sell a few over-the-counter medicines at the clinic... feel free to stop by if you're feeling exhausted.#$b#I know that being a farmer is pretty tiring work... don't overdo it!" 
"I feel responsible for the health of this whole community... it's kind of stressful.#$e#It's a pretty small community, and I'm fortunate to be able to build a good relationship with my patients." 
"I'd like to stay in Stardew Valley for a while. I'm finally starting to feel involved in the community.#$e#It feels good to know that you're useful." 
"Oh! Hi, @.$l#$e#Do you... have any medical questions?$l" 
"Feel free to stop by my office if you're ever feeling ill.#$e#You're young, though. You'll probably stay healthy without trying.$h" 
"Don't overwork yourself, @. Doctor's orders!#$e#Your health is important to me.$l" 
"I'd like to get to know you better, @. Let's put aside our doctor-patient relationship." 
"It's nice to have a friend in town.$h" 
"You have a really healthy glow. That's good.$h" 
"Remember to cover your mouth when you sneeze.#$e#Then make sure to wash your hands." 
"It's a lot of work, being a doctor. I don't eat as well as I should.$s#$e#If I didn't live alone I think it would be easier.$l" 
"Nutrition is important, so make sure and eat well. Try to increase your vegetable intake!#$e#Home-cooked meals are best. Do you cook?" 
"It's a beautiful day, isn't it?#$e#I wish I had less work to do.$s" 
"If you want to hang out in my apartment, that's okay with me. I live above the clinic." 
"Stop by my place if you ever need a confidential check-up.$l" 
"Can I do anything for you?#$e#Take care." 
"I came here because I liked the small-town atmosphere, and the potential for a holistic approach to patient care.#$e#I've grown to really love it.$h" 
"*Sigh*... I'm starting to feel kind of old...#$e#The older you get the more memories you're burdened with. It can be overwhelming.$s#$e#I think I'll stay younger with you around.$l" 
"Hmm... I'm struggling to make ends meet. I don't have enough patients.#$e#I guess I should try to get patients from the neighboring towns..." 
"Imagine having a patient's life completely in your hands, and failing to keep them alive... that's something that will haunt you forever.$s" 
"Thanks, @.$h#$b#You see, George, I'm just trying to help you." 
"*Sigh*$s#$b#Look, George. If you want to behave like this I'm going to have to tell your wife. I don't think she'll be happy." 
"Thanks, @. I appreciate that.$h" 
"*Sigh*... rude.$s" 
"Oh! Hospitals make you nervous, huh?#$b#Just try and relax. I'm here to help.$h" 
"Okay. That makes sense." 
"Um. Okay... If you say so.$s" 
"...You're right.#$b#...Thanks." 
"*sigh*$s" 
"It's okay to get a moderate amount of sunlight. Just don't get burnt.#$e#Okay. Take care! Stay healthy." 
"Exercise is important, but don't get too exhausted, or you might end up at my clinic!#$e#Make sure and listen to your body." 
"People don't get sick much during the summer. That's nice, but it also means less business for me." 
"Have you been going into the mines, @?#$e#It's a dangerous place. I recommend against it." 
"When you eat certain foods you'll perform better.#$e#Eating a 'Farmer's Brunch' will give you the nutrition you need to water and harvest crops better!" 
"It's flu season, so you'd better be extra careful.#$e#Make sure to wash your hands often." 
"I hate to say this, but I do make a lot more money during flu season.#$e#I guess if people stopped getting sick, I'd be out of business.#$e#Don't get the wrong idea! I want people to be healthy... really!" 

"It's a myth that rainy weather causes the flu. However, take care that you don't slip on the mud!#$e#I often worry about you." 
"It was so incredibly lonely living above the clinic by myself... I'm much happier now.$h" 
"I woke up early, but I made sure not to wake you. You looked so peaceful." 
"I don't mind the rain. Sure, I can't watch the planes go by, but I can still listen to the radio chatter.#$e#It makes the whole thing a little more mysterious." 
"I have a backlog of house chores I want to complete today. I've got plenty to keep me busy!" 
"How was your day, honey? I was going to do the dishes but I got absorbed in the latest issue of \"Knee Surgery Enthusiast\"." 
"You know, this 'journal of tendon dynamics' is actually bearable when I'm reading out here." 
"If you're enjoying life, who cares if it's a little repetitive? That's what I say." 
"You look a little soggy, hun. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?^You look a little soggy, dear. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?" 
"The sound of rain gives our minds something to focus on, so we're not distracted by random thoughts.#$e#That's my theory for why it's so soothing..." 
"I made us a nice healthy dinner. Only fresh, wholesome ingredients from the valley! [212 214 225 209 200]$h#$e#Just make sure to eat a reasonable portion, dear." 
"I think we're all striving to reach some kind of balance in life. An equilibrium of complexity.#$e#For me, moving here was exactly what my body needed to find that balance.$l" 
"Good morning, @! I made you a nutritious breakfast.[201]#$e#Eggs are a good source of essential nutrients, so eat up." 
"I'm going to study the medical literature today. It's important for me to keep up-to-date so I can give my patients the best care possible!" 
"I'm going to listen to some jazz music and finalize my medical reports today. What do you have planned?" 
"I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far.$h" 
"You look exhausted, dear. Let me give you a massage tonight. I promise it will reduce the inflammation in your muscle tissue!$l" 
"I took it easy today... spent some time reading books, fiddled with my radio, and worked on a model airplane.#$e#It's important to take a day off now and then to relax... stress is unhealthy." 
"Good evening... did you finish everything you needed to do today?#$e#Don't worry about me. I'm very self-sufficient. If you have more work to do go right ahead." 
"It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as  Farm." 
"Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem." 
"This is a very safe spot. You go on ahead and take care of business, don't worry about me." 
"I believe this must be the ideal place to raise children, scientifically. What do you think?" 
"I may not be the most exciting guy, but I'll stay loyal to you for the rest of my life.$l" 
"@... you... you mean the world to me.$l" 
"As a scientist I'm fascinated by the delicate interplay of insect and plant life." 
"You and 1 are the most important parts of my life." 
"Little 1 is going to have the perfect childhood here. We're really fortunate to have this opportunity." 
"So far, I really like being a father!$h" 
"I already gave 1 and 2 their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!" 
"I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once." 
"Maybe 2 will grow up to become a pilot, like I never could?" 
"My life is devoted to you and the children now, and I'm very happy about it. I always dreamed of having a wonderful family.$l#$e#I had nightmares of being a bachelor forever.... I love you so much.$l" 
"@...I still can't believe we're married...$l" 
"You rescued me from a life of loneliness, and filled the emptiness in my heart. Thank you.$l" 
"I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here... $l^I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here...$l" 
"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?$l^Oh, my... you look beautiful today.$l" 
"Be careful out there! I have nightmares about your limp body being wheeled into the emergency room.$7" 
"I think I'll take a little walk today. I need to unwind." 
"I had a nice day. It's refreshing to spend some time alone now and then. Did you have a good day, honey?" 
"It's wonderful to see all the plants return to life. The greenery is refreshing after a monochrome winter." 
"Oh, it's a festival tomorrow, isn't it? Large crowds, activities... *gulp*$s" 
"W...Will you dance with me at the festival tomorrow?$7#$e#It's always a little embarrassing.$7" 
"Make sure you don't get sunburnt, dear! It's very dangerous for your skin.$8#$e#As your husband and doctor, I consider your health and safety my top priority!" 
"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?#$e#I would put an item of high value and quality. We all want to leave a great impression on the governor!" 
"As summer draws to a close, and the colder season begins, my workload tends to increase. Sorry in advance if I'm a little moody..." 
"Make sure and diversify your harvests this fall, my dear.#$e#Or just grow cranberries... It's really up to you. What do I know?" 
"Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while.$h" 
"I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave." 
"The air is very dry during winter. That's why our skin tends to become irritated.#$e#Don't worry, I'll rub a little truffle oil onto your back every night.$l" 
"Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? I do enjoy the igloos..." 
"Well, here's to a fantastic year. I have complete confidence that next year will be even better!$h" 

"I'll wait here until you're ready to go home..."
"And just a few steps over there, Gus is grilling up a batch of pork ribs... Yikes.$s#$e#I've got some soul-searching to do...$11"
"Hi... I was hoping you'd find me here...$l"
"Oh! You found me...$8#$b#The truth is, I got too scared so I came here to hide. Don't tell anyone.$s"
"How is everyone doing? I'm just taking a break for a little while. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the egg hunt!"
"Eggs definitely have a place in the well-balanced diet.#$e#Oops... I should take off my Doctor's hat for the time being.$11"
"Eggs are fine, but I'd advise against eating thirty per day!"
"I'm working up the courage to ask someone to dance with me.$11"
"Oh dear... I've got sand in my socks...$s"
"Good thing I came with sunscreen.#$e#I wonder if Maru could use some sunscreen on her shoulders?"
"Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!"
"I'm dreaming of our warm fire back home...$l"
"Extreme temperatures can put your body under a lot of stress, so make sure to bundle up!#$e#Oh, and enjoy the festival!$h"
"I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air...$l"
"I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!"

"Oh my goodness! I have so much to prepare before the wedding! I'm nervous.$l#$e#I'll be relieved after we're all settled in on your farm.$h"
"I'm really happy.$h#$e#This was always my secret wish.$l"

"When I'm next to you, I'm not even scared of falling off this cliff and dashing onto the sharp rocks below...
I... I love and admire you very much, @...

"Make sure you stay dry today, dear. I don't want you to become hypothermic."
"Hi. It's good to see you.$h#$e#I spent the day skimming through some medical journals."
"The sky looks great today... so clear!#$e#From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home!"
"You look like you could use a good massage tonight.$l#$e#Doctor's orders... It's good for the circulation!"
"This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day.$l#$e#I love watching you on the farm... hehe"
"I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?"
"#$c .5#Hi, honey. How was your day?#$e#*Phew*... I'm exhausted...$s#$e#My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day."
"Let's plant some healthy vegetables this spring.$h"
"Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin."
"I could sure go for some wine."
"Winter is flu season, so work is probably going to be a lot more stressful. Sorry in advance if I'm grouchy."
No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it's still fun to break out the equipment now and then.#$e#I'm working on a new model plane. It's so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment.
