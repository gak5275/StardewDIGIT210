"I don't know you. Why are you talking to me?" 
"Buh... hope the bar's open." 
"Welp... got my year's supply of Vitamin D. Now I can play video games with the blinds shut the rest of the year." 
"That's right... I'm not wearing any shoes or socks.#$b#Some call it a public health risk.#$b#The crabs seem to enjoy it, though.$h" 
"Hoo... Feels good to rest these hams.#$b#If anyone needs me, I'll just be sitting here, marinating." 
"Phew... feels good to have a cold drink...#$e#Or maybe a few..." 
"Okay, this sand is piping hot. I regret not wearing shoes.$s" 
"...No.$s" 
"I heard you built Pam a house... That's really generous...#$b#You know, I could use a hundred thousand gold myself...#$e#*ahem* ...ah ...Just kidding. ...Heh." 
"I heard someone bought Pam a house... *sigh*... What did Pam ever do to earn that kind of generosity??" 
"...$a#$e#...Leave me alone.$a" 
"*gulp* Oh... Yeah, okay... I guess I should've seen this coming.$s#$b#I'll... uh... guess I'll see you at the Saloon." 
"I don't understand you... *sigh*..." 
"I hardly know you. Why are you talking to me?" 
"Hey. Sorry if I came off as rude when we first met.#$e#It takes me a while to warm up to strangers." 
"Do you ever feel like the whole world is scrutinizing you like some disgusting insect?" 
"What? What do you want? Go away." 
"What do you want from me? Money? I'd give you a pot of gold to leave me alone!" 
"Every time I try something new it goes horribly wrong. You learn to just stay in a shell." 
"Life isn't so bad... at least I have frozen pizza and eggs.$u" 
"No, I don't have time to chat with you." 
"I guess I've grown attached to Marnie and Jas. We're a ragtag bunch but it kind of feels like a weird family.#$e#I never really had much of a family as a kid.$s" 
"$d Joja#*sigh* ...Every day is the same. Stocking those horrible shelves, going to the saloon, tossing and turning all night.$s|I hated my job at JojaMart, but now that I'm unemployed I feel even worse.$s" 
"What do you want? Leave me alone." 
"You're really persistent. I guess I'm just surprised that anyone would be interested in talking to me." 
"Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?" 
"You like talking to me? I guess I believe you... maybe you're as weird as I am.$h" 
"Don't you have work to do?" 
"$d Joja#What's the point of life if all you do is work?|I haven't been able to pay my rent, but Marnie's letting me stay anyway. I'm lucky." 
"I'll definitely be going to the saloon tonight. What else is there to do?" 
"Why are you bothering me? I want to be alone." 
"I'm surprised that you're still trying to make friends with me. Haven't I been rude enough to you yet?#$e#*sigh*...$s" 
"$d Joja#I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain.|If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course." 
"I've really grown attached to Marnie's chickens.$h" 
"I'm busy, can't you tell?" 
"...I think I might be gaining weight.$s" 
"If I watch more TV maybe I can forget about life. That would be relaxing.$u" 
"Hi, @. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far.$h" 
"Hmm... it's %time. Should I throw a frozen pizza in the microwave, or should I wait?$u" 
"You again? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone?$s" 
"Okay... that'll require a great script. Maybe I'll ask Elliott for advice next time I see him at the saloon.$s" 
"Sounds great. I'll have to create a bunch of practical effects to make it look cool." 
"I didn't know you were such a miser...$s" 
"Okay, Dad...$s^Okay, Mom...$s" 
"Oh, wow...$s" 
"...Yeah, me too." 
"I know... that's why I stopped by, to tell you about it." 
"Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..." 
"Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense.$6#$b#Me? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes.#$b#But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out.$l" 
"Oh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city?$6#$b#I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know." 

"I hope Jas and Marnie are doing alright without me.#$e#I'm not too worried... Jas is old enough now to take care of the animals on her own." 
"You know what? I think I've lost some weight since moving in with you.$6" 
"Here... take this.[346 174 303 305 215]#$e#I bought some of those a while ago and they're almost expired..." 
"Buhh... I don't feel like being productive today." 
"@, should I do something useful today?... or just nap forever?" 
"Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls.#$e#Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.$h" 
"Charlie's doing well.$8" 
"The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place." 
"I guess... if I had some pants I might've gone outside today... but, nah." 
"I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens." 
"Tip-tappa-tip-tappa-tip... I'm starting to feel thirsty.$6" 
"Buh... sometimes life feels like a slow, gray blur... know what I mean?" 
"Hey. Take this... I put a bit too much in the microwave. [195 215 206]#$e#Sorry if it's squishy." 
"Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens." 
"*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.$6" 
"I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy.$6" 
"I'm just gonna have a couple more beers before closing my eyes for the night." 
"If... If only... ah, I was just thinking back on the glory days, when I played gridball on the varsity team.$6#$b#Now I'm old and weak, though..." 
"Ughh... *gurgle*... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce." 
"Buh... I wish I was six inches taller and a whole lot smarter...#$e#You like me for who I am? I still have a hard time understanding that..." 
"I spent all day watching TV and now my legs feel like soft dough. Guess I'll have to take it easy until tomorrow." 
"I didn't sleep well last night so I'm hoping this fresh air will get the juices flowing.#$e#What juices, you ask? Heh... you're weird.$h" 
"Sometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh.#$e#But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway?$h" 
"When I stop and think about it... I'm in a good place. My life is pretty nice.$6" 
"Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers.$s" 
"Hey, @. You were sleeping like a baby so I slipped out of bed and went for a morning walk around the farm. Everything looks fine." 
"It's weird, when I was younger I swore I'd never have a kid. I wonder what happened to me?$6" 
"Let's make sure to give 1 lots of eggs... Baby's gotta grow those legs!" 
"Papa Shane reporting for duty...$6#$e#Buh... I've become corny in my old age." 
"I already fed the kids two bowls of pizza puffs cereal. They'll be full for a while." 
"I'll be honest... two kids is enough for me." 
"Ugh... 2 is being a little brat today. Must've gotten that from me..." 
"*Sigh*... If only we could send the kids off to Joja work-camp for a season...#$e#I'm just kidding.$h" 
"*Sniff*... *sniff*... mmm... what's that wonderful fragrance you're wearing? Eau de pepperoni?$6" 
"You're a lot better-looking than me, you know that?$h" 
"The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke." 
"I'm in a great mood today... The Tunnelers won big last night.$h" 
"Hey, if I ever seem cranky, just ignore it. I get in weird moods sometimes, but it's not about you... okay?" 
"Ah... life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting.$h#$e#You think it was depressing out front? Kid, you should've seen the back room..." 
"Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need.$h" 
"I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV." 
"Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You really have a short memory span, don't you? *blush*$h" 
"Oh, do you need something from me? Sorry, I'm kind of busy at the moment." 
"Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now..." 
"Working at Joja was a drag, but at least I got to interact with people occasionally." 
"What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually..." 
"Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to work at Joja." 
"If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys." 
"Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright." 
"Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?" 
"What do you want? You sound like Marnie on one of her bad days. Go away.$a" 
"Farm-life is actually really boring. What am I doing here?$s" 
"Yeah... *hic* ... Sure, honey. Whatever you say... *hic*" 
"I'm going to go out today, alright?" 
"Sorry if I'm sweaty... That was quite a walk... Buh, I'm out of shape.$6" 
"Ooo... my throbbing head. How many did I have last night?" 
"The egg festival is probably my favorite... you know how I am, I go crazy for anything to do with chickens.$h" 
"Oh, right. It's the flower dance tomorrow. Hey, if it makes you happy, I'm happy." 
"I like seeing all the tropical plants this time of year. The valley gets so lush." 
"I might fast until the luau tomorrow. I need the ol' bag to be empty so I can fill it with piping hot soup.$h" 
"What are your plans for the fall? I'm going to try and incorporate more wine into my diet." 
"Hmm... I might have to buy a few cases of pumpkin ale to celebrate the season...$6" 
"I'll be helping Marnie with the animals at tomorrow's fair, like usual. You should just kick back and have some fun.$6" 
"I'm starting to really feel my age... and I'm not comfortable with that at all." 
"Any big plans this winter? I'll probably end up watching a lot of TV and just hanging out around the house." 
"Well, another year gone by... I look a little older, but that's about all.$6" 

"All these animals are friendly and love to get massaged."
"Why is there no more pumpkin ale?"
"Our hens have been working overtime to prepare for this festival.#$b#They deserve the best tonight... bowls full of sweet yellow corn!$h"
"Some of these eggs were laid just this morning. See? They're still warm!"
"Mmm... excellent sauce. *slurp*#$e#Ah, this green stuff is spicy! *munch*#$b#*crunch* ...ow.$s"
"Wow... you don't get hot pepper chutney like this in the big city..."
"The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back again a year from now... nature is amazing."
"If it was up to me, I'd probably have a pizza festival at the saloon, instead..."
"I've met some people who believe in spirits, and magic... but me? I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by science."
