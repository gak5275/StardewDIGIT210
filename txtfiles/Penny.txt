"#$p 7#But if I keep trying I think I can get her to change.|I guess it makes sense. There's not much I can do to change it, anyway." 
"That's how I feel. I'm just going to focus on making the future better." 
"Maybe you're right. It's better to cope with reality.$u" 
"I'm eager to move out. It's such a burden to be worrying about Mom all the time.#$e#I want her to be happy, but I can't stay here forever... you know?$s" 
"I'm tutoring Vincent and Jas today... They're a handful, but it's nice to make a difference in someone's life."

"Um, @? A farm seems like a good place for children, don't you think?$l#$e#It was just a thought I had.$l" 
"We don't have a school here but I'm doing my best to give Vincent and Jas a proper education.#$e#Every child deserves a chance to be successful.#$e#Jas is very good at math and reading. Vincent is good at... well, he has an active imagination!" 
"You know what? I should take the children on a field trip some time. Maybe to the forest.#$e#A guest speaker would be nice... maybe someone familiar with nature?#$e#Sorry, I'm just thinking out loud." 
"I've lived in Pelican Town my whole life. Can you believe that?#$e#I guess there's a lot out there I'll never experience." 
"We're very lucky to have a library in such a small town.#$e#When you're lost in a book, it's easy to forget the realities of your life.$u#$e#...Maybe that's why I like reading so much.$s#$e#...Sorry. I got carried away there." 
"I wish I could keep a garden, but our yard is such a mess.$u#$e#Maybe I'll live in a place where I can have a garden someday.#$e#Maybe I'll live on a farm! *giggle*$h"

"Dishes, dishes, dishes. Ugh... If my mother wasn't always nursing a headache from her late nights at the saloon, maybe she could help around the house a little.$s" 
"This is such a small town. You can't avoid meeting everyone.#$e#I wonder what it's like to live in the city?" 
"Things changed a lot after the JojaMart went up. It's been really bad for Pierre's shop. Mom loves JojaMart, though. The prices are cheap, so she can afford a lot more there than she ever could at Pierre's.|Mom's been complaining ever since JojaMart closed down. I think it's good for her, though. Maybe she'll drink less Joja Cola now." 
"Hello. Ummm...$u#$b#The weather's interesting today, don't you think?#$e#Sorry...$u" 
"I've been trying to keep our place clean, but it always gets messy again.$s#$e#It's hard to run a household all by yourself.$u" 
"Oh no?$l#$b#Well, I guess that makes sense... you're busy with other things right now." 
"... Me too. I'm glad you feel that way.$7" 
"Yes... the urge to care for something innocent and helpless. It makes sense that we'd feel that." 
"Oh, really?$s#$b# I think you'd make a good parent.$7" 
"hmm...$s#$b#If everyone thought like that, humans would die out.$s" 
"Oh...$s#$b#That's kind of sad... but I guess I can understand your point.$s"

"Hello. Ummm...$u#$b#The mountains look nice today, don't they?$u" 
"Hi... Um, are you doing okay?$u"

"Are you friends with Linus? He lives in a tent up in the mountains.#$e#Everyone ignores him, the poor guy. He's actually really nice... Just a little odd.#$e#It must be so cold to live in a tent this time of year." 
"I'm looking forward to seeing what your farm looks like in the spring.#$e#It's going to be so fresh and beautiful.$h"

"Hi, honey! I did some shopping this morning and got this for you.[186 180 770 535]#$e#I thought you could really use one of the those.$11" 
"Hmm... maybe I should experiment with a new recipe. You liked the last recipe I made, didn't you, honey?#$e#What was it called... 'Chili de @'?" 
"On days like this, I love to curl up with a good book." 
"How was your day, honey? I spent my afternoon reading a novel." 
"This is a lot more peaceful than my old spot in town. I'm very happy here." 
"I'm sure Mom's at the saloon right now... But I don't feel so bad about it anymore. It's out of my hands." 
"I was just thinking about that night we met in the bathhouse.$l#$e#I'll never forget that night...$l" 
"The sound of rain used to bother me, when I lived in that old metal trailer. But it's quite soothing here." 
"I felt like making a nice dinner. I hope you like it. [212 214 225 209 200]$h"

"Good morning, @! I made you a hot breakfast.[195 210 211]#$e#It's important to me that you leave here with a full belly.$h" 
"You know, I think I'll read a book today. I picked up something new from the library last time I was there.#$e#Gunther asked me to say hi." 
"I love to hear about all the artifacts you've found. Archaeology is fascinating!#$e#To think... there may have been farmers at this very spot 10,000 years ago." 
"Was I shy when we first met? It's funny to think about, now that we've come so far.$h" 
"Good evening, honey. Did you accomplish everything you wanted to today?#$e#If not, that's okay. We've got all the time in the world!" 
"Hmm... skirt or pants tomorrow? Oh, who am I kidding... I always go with the skirt." 
"We have it good here. We should always try and remember those less fortunate than us.#$e#I'm just very grateful for what we have." 
"Mom's probably pretty lonely now that I'm gone. I just hope she doesn't visit the saloon more to make up for it.#$e#You shouldn't feel bad! Mom has to solve her own problems. " 
"Ready to tuck in? I made the bed and everything...$11" 
"I only ever dreamed of living in such a beautiful place, and now it's come true.#$e#I was so miserable back home.$s"

"Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!#$e#I'll be thinking of you.$h" 
"I just saw a songbird flying due west. In Stardew Valley that's a very good omen.$h" 
"Ahh... It feels great to be outside. I could spend all day right here, observing every little thing." 
"Have you had any time to play with 1 today? Maybe a second child will make things better." 
"Little 1 is going to have such a great childhood here." 
"I feel a lot older now that we have a child. Maybe it's just this new responsibility weighing on me.#$e#It's not bad! I've wanted this for a long time.$11" 
"I already gave 1 and 2 their food. They're such hungry children!" 
"We have to make sure and give 1 a lot of attention now that we have 2. We don't want any jealousy between them." 
"I've had this dream that 2 grew wings and flew into the night sky. What does it mean?" 
"A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. We're so very fortunate." 
"@...I still can't believe we're married...$l" 
"I had dreams of marrying you for such a long time.$l" 
"I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here...$l" 
"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?$l^Wow, you look beautiful today. Did you do something different with your hair?$l" 
"This place is really starting to feel like home.$l" 
"Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry that you aren't eating enough wholesome food." 
"I'm going to head into town today, just for fun. I'll be back in a while!" 
"I had a nice time... It's good to stay in contact with everyone. Tell me about your day." 
"Spring is probably my favorite season. There's a certain freshness in the air that fills me with hope." 
"We've got a long, warm year to look forward to. Let's make it a productive one." 
"Ah, the 'spring cleaning'... I'm actually going to enjoy this." 
"*phew*... I need to eat more melon to combat this heat!" 
"Summer may be searing hot, but the humidity feels great on the skin." 
"In summer, the ants become very active. I could watch them for hours... they have a pretty complex civilization from the looks of it!" 
"The smell of fall reminds me of the smell of books... weird, isn't it?" 
"Fall... It makes me think of colored paper and glue. Maybe I'm spending too much time with the children.$h" 
"Will you grow any giant pumpkins this year?$11" 
"Winter's a good time to unwind a bit. You deserve it after the long year!" 
"The falling snow reminds me of grandma, rocking by the fire. I have this vivid memory of her shadow, flickering against the orange wood... That was long ago." 
"How will we stay afloat this winter? Oh, you don't have to tell me... I trust you to make the right decisions." 

"I hope we win the grange display contest!"
"I won the wheel of chance ten times in a row and now the man won't let me play anymore...$s"
"Oh... These vapors... Hmmm... You look nice tonight.$l"
"The vapor from this cauldron... it's making my head spin, but I can't seem to leave...$u"
"Maru's trying to convince me to eat a deviled egg. I'm just not sure I can stomach it..."
"The children have been looking forward to this festival for weeks."
"Hopefully Vincent will be able to find an egg this year... #$b#It would be good for him to feel like he's a contender."
"*gulp*... I'm nervous.$s"
"I'm just humoring some old friends. What I really want is a bowl of that soup."
"We do this festival every year to give the governor a taste of everything the valley has to offer.#$e#Mayor Lewis hopes it will get the governor on our good side. That's why he's so neurotic about the way the soup tastes."
"Life is so easy for a jellyfish... just letting the waves carry you onward forever."
"Are you entering the fishing contest this year, @? My mom's pretty serious about winning."
"$y 'Hmm... What kind of snowman should we make?
	I guess maybe it's best to stick with the classics, huh?
	Okay! That sounds like fun.
	Um, okay... I think I might stick with something more conventional.'"
"I'm thankful to have met you...$l"
"What a beautiful tree.$h"

"@.. I'm a little scared. This is such a big change!#$e#Don't worry, I'm really happy, too.$h"
"We're going to have a little farm family, soon.$l#$e#I'm so glad you feel this way about me.

"We have a beautiful home and a thriving family... it's all I've ever dreamed of, and more.

"I think I might do some baking today.
"Oh... the smell? I tried to do some baking... It didn't work out too well.
"This place is so big compared to the trailer, I feel overwhelmed... In a good way!
"Hi there, honey. Ready to spend a quiet evening at home?"
"I'm really happy on our little farm, @.
"I have to go into town today. Don't work too hard, and eat something good for lunch!
Good evening. My day was fine, thanks! How was yours?$h#$e#Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up...
"I'm so happy to see some greenery after that long white winter."
"Are you growing any melons this summer?"
"It's so peaceful out here on the farm. I never appreciated nature that much living in town."
"I'm going to do a lot of reading this winter."
I always wanted my very own library. This is so charming.$h#$e#I like to do a little reading first thing in the morning. It gets my brain into gear.

"Sorry about what happened at my place yesterday... My mom can get into bad moods sometimes.^Please just forget it happened.

“A word of warning, my mother really hates ''. Just the thought of it can make her depressed.”

“	“If you want my mother to dislike you, give her ''. She hates it with a passion. I think she might be allergic.”

“I'm going to go inside, I just wanted a quiet moment.”

“	“I have an appointment at the clinic this afternoon.”

“Can you smell that? The air is so spicy here...”

“Oh... No, thanks.”
