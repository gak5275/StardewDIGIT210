"Did you watch the game last night?#$b#Or wait, do you even have a TV set...?" 
"Ugh, I stepped in something gross earlier... and I just bought these shoes.$s" 
"Hey, I'm Sam. Good to meet you.$h" 
"Wow, what a spot!" 
"I bet there's some cool stuff deeper on the island.#$e#Willy said we have to stay here, though... some kind of liability issues or something.$s" 
"I'm feeling pretty good from all the sunlight.$h" 
"Check out these gnarly waves... Guess what? I'm gonna save up for a surfboard." 
"Maybe I should learn to play the ukelele.#$e#Abby on the congas and Sebastian on the steel drums... 'The Pelicans of Paradise'...$s#$e#What's the matter, you look worried.$h" 
"I'm just getting juiced up, then it's back to the beach." 
"Hmm... I dunno. Maybe next year.$s" 
"...$a" 
"Alright, I'm done with the cold shoulder act. Let's just forget about what happened.$7" 
"Wait... what?!$8#$b#I thought we were doing okay... I guess I was way off... alright, then.$9#$b#Yeah, sure... we can still be friends.$9" 
"I'm sorry, @. I don't think I can still be your friend.$s" 
"Hey, how's it going?#$e#Last night I practiced guitar for 4 hours straight. My fingers hurt like crazy.$s#$e#Bye, I've got something to do..." 
"Hey, farmer." 
"I'll tell you a secret... my name 'Sam' is short for 'Samson'.$10#$e#Most people don't know that so keep it on mute." 
"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.#$e#Take it easy." 
"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?#$e#Sleeping feels nice but sometimes I wish I could skip it... it's just such a time-waster." 
"I'm trying to come up with a new song for my band, but I'm blanking... Hey.. What do you think my new song should be about?
"$p 19#But I already know what you think about it.$a|Thanks to your help I'm already done with the lyrics!$h" 
"Hey, man... what the heck is your problem? Sorry I asked.$a" 
"Hey, you know what? That sounds perfect. Thanks!$h" 
"I've been friends with Sebastian for a while. He's a pretty cool guy.#$e#If you two weren't around I wouldn't really have any friends in town." 
"Hey buddy. You look like you're full of energy today!^@. Um... I just wanted to say... You look nice today.$10" 
"I think my Dad might be coming back in a year or so.#$e#I guess you might be able to meet him, then. If you're still living here.#$e#You wouldn't abandon the farm after putting so much effort into it!" 
"...I have mixed feelings about my father being back. He seems strange.$s#$b#But I guess I haven't seen him in 3 years... so that could explain it." 
"*sigh*... what am I still doing here?" 
"The clouds look great this time of year, don't they?#$e#Like scoops of vanilla ice cream floating on blue raspberry sauce... Or maybe I'm just hungry." 
"My Dad is a soldier, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here...#$e#He'll come back someday.#$e#...I've heard some terrible things about the Gotoro Empire...$s" 
"Well, my Dad is back. Have you met him?#$b#I'm just glad he's okay." 
"Well, my Dad is back. Have you met him?#$b#I'm just glad he's okay." 
"Did I ever tell you we used to live in the city?#$e#There's a lot more stuff going on, but it's also kinda noisy and hectic... It's hard to say which is better." 
"Dad used to work as a garbage man in the city.#$e#You don't even want to know some of the things he found in people's trash." 
"The older I get the more attached I feel to the valley.#$b#Although I could be biased... for a certain reason.$10#$e#So, how are you doing today?$h" 
"Oh! I just remembered I'm supposed to call my Grandma. Okay, I'm going to put this rubber band on my wrist so I don't forget.#$e#I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things.$h" 
"Hmm. I just remembered that I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.#$e#This happens to me all the time." 
"Sometimes I wonder if my mother is actually happy with her life...$s#$e#I asked her once and got the feeling she was hiding some inner pain." 
"Oh, it's a nice day... isn't it?" 
"Sometimes those spring petals that float around make my nose drip.$s#$e#I like summer best, myself." 
"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band." 
"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band." 
"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band." 
"Hey, you know what? That's exactly the kind of style I've been thinking about... for the band." 
"Oh, I see." 
"My little brother gets so excited for festivals. He's been talking about tomorrow's egg hunt all day." 
"Why couldn't the flower dance be today so I could get work off?$s" 
"One time, Gus fell in the river during the Ice Festival. We had to build a huge fire in the saloon to dry him out.#$e#We were all worried we'd never taste his famous spaghetti ever again." 
"Tonight, after everyone is asleep, that weird old man who lives in the woods will set up the haunted maze. He always makes sure no one is around to see him working." 
"I don't have to work tomorrow! I've never been so happy.$h" 
"The Feast of the Winter Star is supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in life.#$b#Me? I'm mostly interested in the food. Hehe.$h" 
"Yeah... That's what happened!" 
"He's right... That's what happened.$s^She's right... that's what happened.$s" 
"Yeah... That's what happened!" 
"What!? He's lying!$a^What!? She's lying!$a" 
"Hey, how's it going?#$e#I'm hungry.#$e#See you later." 
"Have you been to the desert yet?#$e#You can find some interesting things there. Dad took me a couple times when I was younger." 
"There's a little less pollen in the summer... my nose is really happy." 
"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.#$e#Goodbye for now." 
"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?#$e#I'm so energized during summer I hardly have to sleep!" 
"Hi. Taking the day off?#$e#Sounds interesting." 
"I saw a spider on my ceiling last night. They sure like the warmth.#$e#I hope he didn't crawl into my mouth while I was asleep...$s" 
"Dad was telling me about our national enemy, the Gotoro Empire... They sound like a ruthless bunch." 
"Sometimes I can hear my Dad pacing down the hallway at night.$s#$b#...But he won't tell us what's troubling him." 
"You know... I used to live in the city and I have to admit, this place is much nicer in the summer.$h#$e#The city is so hot with all that concrete." 
"When you see hot air balloons drifting over the sea, you'll know that summer's in full swing." 
"I like taking walks in the forest this time of year. The temperature is so comfortable#$e#...$h" 
"Oh, hi. Are you making friends with anyone in town?#$e#Bye." 
"My shoes always seem to wear out this time of year. Look, my toe's poking through!$h#$e#That's what happens when you skateboard too much." 
"I ordered a new pair of shoes online. They're the same style so I know they'll fit right." 
"I ordered some shoes online more than a week ago! Man, they're really taking a long time.#$e#I guess we must really live in the middle of nowhere.$s" 
"Ah, my feet feel great in these new shoes. They're a little crisp, but they'll break in. Especially after I run through the haunted maze this weekend.$h" 
"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?#$e#Just stop by whenever you want." 
"Hey... something smells good, like pizza.#$e#Do you smell that? Maybe Mom's cooking something." 
"I think my Dad might be coming back next year.#$e#I guess that's kind of soon. Weird." 
"I guess I should start thinking about moving out soon...$s#$e#...But I would miss Mom's fish casserole, so I dunno...$s#$e#I hate making decisions." 
"Did you ever notice all the spider webs that appear during the fall?#$e#If you get up early you'll see them covered in dew... like little stars." 
"I used to live in Zuzu City, you know. The biggest difference is the noise. It's never quiet in the city.#$e#There's way more people around you, always. And it's always bright with city lights, even at night.#$e#I guess which setting you like depends on your personality." 
"I think I've grown to like the country more than the city.$h#$b#Although I could be biased... for a certain reason.$10#$e#So, how are you doing today?$h" 
"I'm lucky to have the biggest room in the house to myself.#$e#I guess there's advantages to being the oldest child." 
"Hmm. I think I was meaning to do something... But I forgot.#$e#This happens to me all the time." 
"The first week of fall is already over. Man, that went by fast.$s#$e#Whatever. I'm just happy that you came to visit me!#$e#So do you have anything new to tell me?" 
"It's hard to have fun on Sunday... I keep thinking about having to go to work tomorrow.$s" 
"Hi @.#$e#Hmm.. I wonder if I could grow a cactus in my room?" 
"Everyone's indoors during the winter, so I can play guitar as loud as I want.$h" 
"Hi... Cold, isn't it?" 
"Oh, hi! It's good to see you again.#$e#Take it easy." 
"Hi, @. Do you want to hang out or something?#$e#Well, it's a good time of year to catch up on all the sleep I've missed.$h" 
"I hate working at JojaMart, but how else am I going to make money in this town?|I'm glad I work at the museum now. It's way more interesting than that depressing JojaMart ever was." 
"I think my Dad is coming back this spring.#$e#It's been 3 years since I've seen him. This is going to be strange." 
"Dad's been back for a while now. I guess I'm finally getting used to it." 
"My Dad is in the military, fighting against the Gotoro Empire. That's why he's not here.#$e#He's coming back soon, though." 
"One thing that's nice about winter... all the mosquitos are gone." 
"The worst thing about the snow is getting your feet soaked. You're lucky in those thick boots." 
"I just remembered I need to change the strings on my guitar.#$b#Okay, I'm going to write a note on my wrist so I remember to do it tonight.#$e#I have to make little reminders for myself or else I'll totally forget to do things.$h" 
"It would be fun if we could go sledding, wouldn't it?#$e#I don't think there are any good hills nearby.$s#$e#Plus, I don't have a sled.#$e#So, how have you been doing lately?" 
"Try not to make a mess in the house or my Mom will flip." 

"Might be a good day to sit back and jam on the guitar...#$e#Hey, you can relax too if you want." 
"Do you think Sebastian and Abigail will ever hook up?#$e#Heh... now that I'm married I'm trying to get everyone else married too." 
"Hey, I found one of these rolling around in the back of a drawer. [90 88 86 535]#$e#I thought you might be able to use it." 
"Aw, man. These cloudy days are kind of a drag...$7" 
"How'd you sleep? The sound of rain really makes me zonk." 
"*Sigh*... I'm never gonna land this trick...$s" 
"Hey, how was your day? I just layed around and read comics most of the day... it was great.$h" 
"It was a pretty low-key day for me... colas, frozen pizza, a few hours noodling around on the guitar. I feel relaxed." 
"Earlier, I listened to our live recording from that show we played. Remember that? Man, was that sloppy.#$b#It made me a little nervous that you were there, I didn't want to mess up and have you think I was a loser!$10" 
"I hope Vincent's not too lonely now that I'm gone... I kinda felt responsible for the little guy.$s#$e#But, life's all about change... right? Kids need to learn that, eventually... Or else adulthood will destroy them.$7" 
"Hey, I tossed a couple frozen pizzas into the oven. Here's yours. [206]$h" 
"Phew... I'll tell you one thing I don't miss about my old life... working at JojaMart." 
"Hey, I made you some instant pancakes. Enjoy. [211]$h#$e#What? I never learned to cook... mom always did that." 
"Hey. I know I joke around a lot, but I want you to know that I seriously love you...$l" 
"Do you have big plans for the day?#$e#Oh, not me... I usually decide what to do a few moments beforehand..." 
"Um... Maybe I'll help out on the farm some other day. I feel lazy today.$s#$e#You're not mad?" 
"Hey, you look tired. Let me help you relax tonight, okay? Maybe I'll give you a massage later." 
"My day? Oh... I can hardly remember. I didn't really do anything of note. Just relaxed and had a good time." 
"Hey, sorry I didn't make the bed. You know I'm sloppy... that's why you like me, right?$h" 
"The only thing I miss about living at home is Mom's fish casserole" 
"Ready to hit the hay? I actually made the bed for once..." 
"Maybe I should get some off-road wheels for my skateboard. Mayor Lewis can't touch me out here.$h" 
"I always keep an eye on the wide blue sky... you never know when a UFO might go by." 
"Hi, @! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!#$e#I'll try and help you with encouraging thoughts.$h" 
"Something in the air makes me feel positive... maybe it's the faint whiff of pizza from Gus' ovens." 
"Wow... you look great today, and the specks of mud just add some extra charm.$l" 
"I'll change 1's diaper... don't worry about it. You've got enough on your plate." 
"It's weird, but I really like being a father!$h" 
"I think we should have another kid. Why stop now?" 
"I woke up early, fed the kids and changed their diapers! We're all set. You can just focus on raking in that sweet money.$h#$e#I'm just kidding... I didn't marry you for the money." 
"We have to make sure and give 1 a lot of attention now that we have 2. We don't want any jealousy between them." 
"It's fun to see the babies playing with each other. I think they're going to be very close." 
"I never thought I'd become such a family man, but I'm really satisfied with what we've built here. Life is going great.$h" 
"Do you ever think of that night we snuck into my room? I do, often...$l" 
"You know, I think I had a feeling we'd be together from the very beginning. There's just something special between us.$l" 
"Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you do something with your hair?$l^Wow, you look stunning today. Did you do something new with your hair?$l" 
"Be careful out there! I know you go into the caves sometimes... you could be eaten alive in there!" 
"Baby, I was just gonna write you a song on the guitar. But now you're here and I feel relaxed.#$e#I mainly feel like playing guitar when I'm lonely." 
"Baby, talk to me! I'm always interested to hear about your day." 
"I'm gonna visit the family today, okay? I'll be home in the evening." 
"Seeing family is nice, but it's also kind of depressing in a weird way. Like... our lives are totally separate now, and everything feels more formal than it used to.$7" 
"Ub... spring... my doze... allergies.$s" 
"Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be cool to see Sebastian again." 
"Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I thought I could get out of it now that we're married.#$e#Whatever. I guess it's funny in a weird way." 
"The pollen count is a little lower in summer, so my nose is really happy.$h" 
"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?#$e#It might be funny to put something nasty. You know, to play a prank on the governor!$h#$e#Sorry..." 
"Summer's great, but I'm ready for the fall now.#$e#Should we watch the jellyfish tomorrow night? It's always kind of fun." 
"It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here." 
"Hey, tomorrow's the fair. I need to get my old slingshot wrist back in shape..." 
"I wonder if Mom will let Vincent enter the haunted maze this year. Probably not...$h#$e#Poor kid. He's gonna have to grow up some day..." 
"The cold air makes my hair gel freeze. It's not very pleasant.$s" 
"Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? It might be fun to see everyone again..." 
"We had a great year, @... it's kind of sad that it's over.#$e#We'll just have to make next year even better!$h" 

"Sebastian's the same as always. Are you having fun at the festival?"
"Hey @. Having a good time?#$e#The slingshot tent is pretty fun, and if you get good at it you can really rack up the star tokens."
"Hey, I was wondering when you'd show up!$h"
"That's odd... It's just a dead end up ahead.#$e#I could've sworn there was someone ahead of me when I went through the maze, though. Where'd they go?"
"The gang's just the same as always. Are you having a good time?"
"*sniff*... ub... my doze... allergies...$s"
"You know what? I admit it... I really like flowers!"
"I guess it wouldn't be very nice to put something nasty in the soup..."
"Governor? Who cares...#$e#Why should I care about some random old guy?"
"I wonder if they're poisonous?#$e#Maybe I shouldn't push Sebastian in the water after all...$h"
"Aren't you cold? Are you sure you don't want my jacket?"
"Hey, @. Are you gonna enter the ice fishing competition?#$e#Oh, not me. I don't know how to fish."
"*yawn*... I'm here for the gifts and the cookies.$h"
"I'm thankful for my guitar and my skateboard. Oh, and my family I guess."

"I'm going to be really happy as your husband, @.$l#$e#I'm excited."
"I never dreamed this would happen. I'm so lucky.$l#$e#I can't wait till the wedding.

"Hey, don't look in there!

"I feel like I've changed a lot from when we first met... you know?#$b#...you might call it 'maturity'... hehe.$10#$b#But I'm at a place, now, where I'm actually really excited about our future together...$l#$b#Even if that means just doing normal stuff, like... uh... buying groceries and changing diapers... hah...

"I might spend some time today fixing any leaks in the roof or the windows."
"Vincent called. He said he misses me and also to tell you hi.
"There's too much stuff I want to get done today... Maybe I'll just watch TV instead."
I wonder if the moon is visible tonight?#$e#So, did you get everything done on the farm today? If you didn't I won't be mad!"
"Hey, look at those puffy clouds in the sky, honey!$h#$e#I'm going to watch those for a while, if you don't mind."
"*sniff* ... My doze is stubbed up... allergies."
"Summer always makes me want to eat more barbecue."
"I wonder what's going on in the rest of the world? We're really secluded here."
"I've given up on being a musician. I'm a family man now!"
The old guitar... I don't have as much drive to play it anymore. That's fine.#$e#What's on your agenda today?"

"Aw, yea! This is my absolute favorite!/90 206 655 658 562 731/Thanks! I really like this./167 210 213 220 223 224 228 232 233 239 -5/Hmm.. this is... interesting./-81 80 152 330 -75/You really don't get it, huh?/306 307 342 -15 2/You got that for me? Thanks!//"

“Hmm.. if I give the cue ball a bit of a top spin, maybe I could
*Sigh* I'm not very good.”

“Hmm... I dunno. Maybe next year.”
“You want to be my partner for the flower dance?" ... "Okay. I look forward to it.”

Hello @. Nice day, isn't it?\I'm just keeping an eye on my little brother. It's good for him to get some fresh air on a day like this.\Our Dad used to take us to the beach on sunny days like this.$h\Of course, Vince. Dad's going to come back as soon as he possibly can.$7\Don't believe everything you hear!$8\Don't you remember how strong Dad is? He'd never let a pathetic Gotoro grunt get him like that! Don't you worry!$a#$b#And always remember that Mom and I are here to play with you if you ever feel lonely.\To be honest, I have no idea if my old man will come back... We've all read the reports. Our soldiers are falling by the thousands.$s#$b#But what am I going to say to Vincent?$7\Hey did I tell you the band's starting to come together?#$b#Yeah!

You look like you've been working hard out there!\Hey, I was just thinking...$s#$b#You know, I really like living here with you. I mean... I love it!#$b#But, I feel like I've gotten really lazy. I just bum around aimlessly every day.$s\Oh, I know you don't mind! You make enough money on the farm that I don't really need to work, and I really appreciate that!#$b#But I want to feel like I'm contributing to something... know what I mean?\So... I think I'm gonna try to find some work... something to do with music.#$b#That's always been what I love the most!$h#$b#Oh, uh... besides you, of course!$8#$b#Heh...$10\Anyway...

Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it.$7\I mean... you're right, someone's gotta make children's music. But it's not exactly a 'dream job'...$7\Ah well... that's okay. I'll make the best of it, like I always do.$7\I guess I'd better start 'thinking like a kid'...\Hey!\Hmm... That's not a bad idea.
