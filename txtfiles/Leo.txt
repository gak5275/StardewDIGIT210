"I saw a big mango floating in the sky. Linus told me it was a hot-air balloon!$u#$b#I thought only birds could fly..." 
"When I first arrived, Linus made me a suit out of leaves, like his...#$b#But I looked funny... like a fuzzy mango!$h#$e#I think I'll stick to my feathers." 
"I need to find some place to live...$s#$b#But I have a plan... I'm going to rely on my friends." 
"It felt bad at first... to leave the island and set foot in a strange land.$s#$e#But, I got used to it after a while.#$b#I'm a very flexible person!$h" 
"I felt like a stranger here, at first. But I've made a lot of friends!$h#$b#For once, I feel like I belong..." 
"Miss Penny is doing her best to get me up to speed in my schooling. She's really nice...#$e#...Luckily, I remember some things from my old, old life... before washing up on the island... so it's not as difficult as it could be.#$e#Miss Penny says she's impressed with how much I know!" 
"I'm sure Jas and Vincent thought I was weird, at first. I accidentally squawked at the school table a few times... that didn't help.$s#$e#It was a big change for everyone. But we're good friends now!$h" 
"Between Linus and Miss Penny, I'm going to learn everything there is to learn!$h#$e#Mayor Lewis says I'm on the fast track to becoming a 'well-rounded citizen'... whatever that means." 
"Have you ever noticed all the interesting birds that live here?#$e#If you listen closely, they might tell you something." 
"The birds of this valley don't mind the cold so much.#$e#I'm a little jealous of their warm coats...$s" 
"Linus has been teaching me about all the wild food in the valley. There's a lot of good stuff out here!$h#$e#Though... I do kind of miss having golden walnuts for breakfast every morning...$s" 
"Linus taught me how to make a special spice berry rubbed fish...#$b#He says if I eat enough of it it'll keep me warm this winter!$h" 
"Uncle Linus says I should 'cook' my fish before eating it...$s#$b#I'm having a hard time getting used to it... so dry...$s" 
"Hey, @. Nice to see you back on the island, just like old times. This is fun!#$e#You know, I was scared when you first arrived... I knew my life was about to change.$u" 
"You know, Stardew Valley might be my new home... but the island will always be my home, too.#$e#It's nice to be able to come back and visit." 
"Maybe some day, I'll visit Zuzu City...$u#$b#But I'm not even close to being ready, yet. This world is already so strange to me, and I'm very comfortable here right now!$h" 
"The parrots want me to thank you for all the golden walnuts you've found. They're really enjoying them.$h" 
"@? Um... I'm a little embarrassed to ask...$u#$b#But... do you think Jas would ever like a guy like me?$u#$b#Or am I too weird?$s#$e#Hahaha... who cares. I'll figure it out some day.$h" 

"Hi... Everything okay?" 
"I've learned a lot from my parrot family...#$b#But I'm sure there's a lot more out there I don't know.$s" 
"When Sun is angry, it feels good in the jungle.#$e#Sun can't find us beneath the leaves. We trick him! Haha...$h" 
"...Sorry... I'm shy today.$3" 
"Be careful in the volcano... the spirits don't like outsiders." 
"Have you met the others like you?#$b#I don't talk to them much. I feel safer with my own kind...$3" 
"One time... I was at the top of the volcano at night, and I saw lights far, far away.#$b#I wonder if there are other bird families out there?$3" 
"I wonder if I could see your home from the top of the volcano?" 
"...I'm sad today.$s#$e#You go on... have fun. Let me be sad.$s" 
"When it rains, strange birds visit.#$b#I try to speak to them... but they fly away.$s#$b#I guess they don't want to be friends...$s" 

"Haha! I've never seen anything like this before...$h"
"The idea of an egg hunt is a little bit weird... but I guess the eggs don't belong to any of my family members...$s#$b#Oh well, I'll join in anyway!$h"
"The flowers here are nice, but they aren't as colorful as back home!$h#$e#I wonder if I'll ever have to get up there and dance...$u"
"Shhh... I'm learning the secrets of the perfect roast."
"The moonlight jellies are my old friends... they come to the island every year, too."
"Linus feels uncomfortable about joining in, so I'm going to keep him company.#$e#We'll have our own little feast... mashed winter root and spice berry fish!$h"
"You could make an igloo twice as warm if you stuffed feathers in the walls!"

"It seems like you're going to live.$u#$b#My bird-friends spotted you and told me you were in danger, so I dragged you all the way down here.$s#$b#Please be safe out there. I don't want to be sad anymore...$s"

"I love this. I'm going to put it in my nest./444 289 834 906/Are you sure? This is so nice.../852 396 392 394 397 905/Oh... I don't know if I can digest this.../-7 -81 2 330 303 459 342 346 348/*sniff* *sniff*... Why are you giving this to me? Do you want me to bury it for you?/257 253 247 271 283 304 303 346 873 348 459 167/I accept your gift./-4 395/"

"Hi @,^^Last night, I found you slumbering in the dark.^It wasn't a very safe place, so the bird friends air-lifted you to your bed.^Please be careful from now on.^^^^P.S. Willy helped me write this."

"@,^Here's a food from my home, that me and my family enjoy. Hope you like it.

"The valley is peaceful when it rains.#$e#To me... nature is someone I know, with different moods."

"Sorry...$u\"
"It's hard to remember to talk... normally...$s\"
"You think I'm weird, don't you?$s\"
"Thanks for saying that.\"
"Thanks, I've gotten used to you too!$h\"
"Hehe... You're getting pretty good at that!$h\"
"Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I had never washed up on this island...$s\"
"Back home, I didn't really care about birds. I never thought to listen to what they might be saying.$s\"
"Though I guess that's normal for... normal kids.$s\"
"I wonder what... normal kids would have to say about me...$s\"
"Do you think I could ever be a normal kid again?$s\"
"Hmmm... I guess you're right.$u\"
"Though living on this island has given me a lot of experiences normal kids would never have.$h\"
"If it weren't for the parrots... who knows what would have happened to me.\"
"I'm happy I met them. I'll always consider them to be my family, even if that makes me a little strange.$h\"
"Anyways, thanks for talking to me, @.\"
"Maybe some day, you can be a part of our family too, hehe.$h\"
"Here, let me teach you how to say \"Let's play\" in parrot talk!\"

"L... leave the island?$u\"
"O... other kids?$u\"
"I... $u#$b#I'll go...\"
"But... my family...$s\"
"She says...\"
"She says the parrots are all happy for me.#$b#...And that they want me to start the next chapter of life, wherever it may lead...\"
"And no matter what happens... they'll always be my family... forever.\"
"Goodbye!\"
"I'm ready!$h\"

"What are you doing, @?\"
"Waves...$s#$b#The other birds say the reason Leo can't fly... is because Leo spend too much time in the waves, long ago.$s#$b#My wings full of water, now.$s\"
"Fish? Easy... $h#$b#If you want to say 'hi', you just have to ask.\"
"Hmm... I don't understand that, yet.$s#$b#Maybe when I become an elder, someday.\"
"Oh.. Yeah. Leo ponders the big questions, too.\"
"Like... 'will I find more walnuts on the beach, or in the volcano?'\"
"*sigh*...Life complicated...$s\"
"@?$s\"
"Tell me about the place you come from... your home.$s\"
"People...$s\"
"Sounds nice.\"
"Cold? ...I don't understand...$s\"
"Farm? So, you're saying you grow your own walnuts? You don't have to hunt for them?$3#$b#...Wow..$3\"
"I'm thinking... @ is smart.$h\"
"Are... Are there... other kids?$s\"
"...I know I'm not actually a bird, @...$s#$b#I'm like you.$s#$b#But I don't like thinking about it...$s#$b# ...because I'm so alone.$s\"
"With my bird family, I feel like I belong.$s\"
"But... I don't belong.$s#$b#...I don't belong anywhere...$s\"

"It's ready!\"
"Haha! ...That was a great day!$h\"
"You know... I still miss my family back on the island...$s\"
"But mostly, I feel happy about the memories, not sad.\"
"...and I really feel like I belong here!$h\"
"It's a beautiful world, friends...\"
"...and I'm glad to be part of it!$h\"

“I just like looking at the lights. It reminds me of something long, long ago...”

"We don't think like that. We say... 'How many golden walnuts have you eaten?' ...I've eaten 3,729 golden walnuts."

...$u#$b#...Y...You... Bird friend?
...Seem good.
...She ask if you are bird friend.#$b#I told her... yes.
...Big Storm... Waves... Lightning...$s#$b#Mother... Father... swallowed by the sea...$s#$b#I... I washed up on shore...
...No, no, no... Th... That was just a dream... right?
...No... I was born here, just like all the other bird friends. Can't you tell?
*Awk*
If you're a bird
*Awk*
How can you speak?
Haha! See? We speak! We speak!
Hey.
...I remembered something.
My name...
...It's Leo.
