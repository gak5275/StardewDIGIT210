"Well hello there! I'm Gus, chef and owner of the Stardrop Saloon.#$e#Stop in if you need any refreshments. I've always got hot coffee and cold beer at the ready.$h" 
"*sniff* sniff* ... that sharp smell!#$b#*slurp* *slurp* ... that zesty taste! That gritty texture!#$b#It can only be gourmet tomato salt! I'll trade you for it." 
"Hey, @! Glad you're here. I'm gonna be serving up some good stuff from behind the bar." 
"I'll see you back home, @." 
"Meet me at the bar if you need a beverage." 
"Hey, need a drink? I've got some special beverages that showcase local ingredients from this island.$h" 
"These might be the best crab cakes I've ever made..." 
"Yeah, I know a lot about the people living here.#$e#That's one of the benefits of being a bartender.$h#$e#Sometimes I hear too much..." 
"Hey. I heard what you did for Pam. That was really really nice of you!$h#$e#Sadly, I don't think it will get her to cut back on the 'beverages'..." 
"I saw Pam earlier today... she was grinning from ear to ear! She said someone bought her a new house!#$e#Whoever it was, they truly deserve the best!$h" 
"Good evening. Can I get you anything?" 
"Good evening. Make yourself at home." 
"Hi, Pierre!/Now, what do I need.../Ah, that looks good!/Makin' my special sauce tonight!/Pierre! What's fresh?/Pierre! Waddya got for me?" 
"Hi there @. I'm glad to see you! You're always welcome here." 
"Hi! Please relax and enjoy yourself." 
"Hey, you look like you could use a beverage." 
"Business has been really good tonight. I'm pleased." 
"I sell different dishes each week, so make sure and check in every now and then!#$e#You might taste something spectacular.$h#$e#Just let me know if you have any allergies.$s#$e#Okay, see you around." 
"Emily's been working here for a while now. I don't know what I'd do without her!#$e#I would hate to have to clean all those pots by myself.$s" 
"Pam and Clint come into the saloon almost every night.#$e#I'd probably go out of business if they stopped coming.$h#$e#So make sure you don't drive them away!" 
"Clint comes into the saloon almost every night and sits at the same table by himself.#$e#Sometimes he glances over at Emily with a nervous look. Hmmm.#$e#Maybe that's why he comes in so often. Oh well, that means more business for me." 
"Pam comes into the saloon almost every night and drinks way too much beer.#$e#Ah well, I shouldn't pass judgement on my customers." 
"Hi there, @. If you're ever thirsty, the Saloon is the place to be." 
"I don't actually drink very much myself. I'm mainly doing this to make a living.#$e#Although I do enjoy a taste of the Stardew Valley vintage from time to time." 
"Are you much of a chef, @?#$e#If you have a kitchen and some recipes, you can cook some useful dishes.#$e#Home-cooked meals make great gifts, as well." 
"Business has been pretty steady thanks to my regular customers." 

"Eat as much as you like! It's all free today... compliments of Mayor Lewis.$h#$e#Oh! Make sure to dribble some of my secret sauce on there."
"It's a lot of fun to cook with pumpkin. Such an interesting fruit."
"I hope everyone's enjoying the food... I've been cooking for days to get everything ready.#$b#Fried eggs, boiled eggs, poached eggs, deviled eggs, scrambled eggs, chocolate eggs... you name it!$h"
"Shh... don't tell anyone, but I tried something different this year... Duck eggs in the custard!$h"
"Frog season is really starting to pick up."
"These blasted sand-flies keep landing on the food!"
"'Moonlight Jellies'... I wonder how they taste?$h#$b#I would never try it, of course!$u"
"It's a fine art, making candy canes. You've really got to search far and wide for the best ingredients. They aren't easy to come by these days!$h#$e#I usually use Fern Island Ringfruit for my premier canes, you know. You can't beat that bright red coloring... And it's all natural!#$e#Oh, you want to know the secret to my deluxe double-canes? Okay, but you've got to promise absolute secrecy. *whisper* It's a drop of vanilla in the white candy to complement the cherry flavor.$h#$e#Of course, peppermint candy canes are the standard, and I always make a healthy batch of those as well.#$e#Hey, you look like you're falling asleep. Are you okay?$s"
"Sorry there's no food.#$e#Just wait until the Feast of the Winter Star. You'll be stuffed for days."

"I'm tending the bar on Ginger Island today, but I won't let that stop you from buying something!

"You're giving this... to me? I'm speechless./72 213 635 729 907/Oh, goodness! Are you sure?/348 303 -7 18/No, no, no.../16 330/This is absolute junk. I'm offended./80 167 648/Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.//"

"Ah... what a beautiful day, huh?\"
"You know, as the Saloon owner, I hear about everything that's going on in town.#$b#I remember when you first moved here... everyone was a bit unsure of what to expect.#$b#A stranger from the city... an unknown personality...$s\"
"One sec...\"
"Sorry, I have to stir this pot every 5 minutes.\"
"Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah... you know, it's like when you're making a sauce...\"
"...If you put in a new spice you could ruin everything!$s\"
"...But then again, there's always a chance you'll create something new and delicious! Right? Hahahaha.$h\"
"Er... What I'm trying to say is...$s#$b#It's been great having you in town, and I've come to think of you as one of my good friends!\"

She hasn't paid off her tab in weeks!$s#$b#...But I can't ask her to do it. I know she'll get defensive, and I don't want to hurt her feelings.$s\"
"@, you gotta help me!$s\"
"Er... Well, okay Pam.$s\"
"Thanks, Pam!$h\"
"And thank you, @.$u\"
"Now, let's get you that drink, Pam.$h\"

"Well, folks... once again, we're gathered for a very special occasion.\"
"...A rare visit from a very dear friend...\"
"...My world-famous giant omelet!$h#$b#Zesty bell pepper, juicy tomato, rich mushroom, and tangy cheese... all enrobed in a blanket of rich, fluffy egg. Dig in, folks.\"
"Willy? What do you think?\"
"Is that a good thing?$s\"
"Nope... You can thank @ over at % Farm!\"

"I'm all ears.\"
"That sounds pretty good! I could use some quality veggies for the saloon. How much does it cost?\"
"What was that?#$b#Hahaha... for a moment there, I thought I heard, '25,000g'.$h\"
"Pierre, are you crazy? There's no way I could afford that. I'd have to sell the saloon!$3\"

"Great stuff!\"

"I still dream of that garlic butter.\"
"Me too!\"

"Wait.$u\"
"I know what you were doing, Linus.$3\"
"If you need food... just ask. I don't want anyone in Pelican Town to go hungry.\"
"Here. I've got a basket of zucchini fritters for you. Just make sure you dip them in my spicy marinara!$h#$b#Go on... take it.\"

"Nice!\"
