"Ah, Mayor Lewis told me you just arrived. I'm Marnie!#$e#I sell livestock and animal care products at my ranch. You should swing by some time.$h" 
"Hehe... finally a chance to show off all my hard work at aerobics club.$h" 
"I feel warm." 
"Hee hee... It's interesting to see everyone in their bathing suits." 
"Ew... the chair's wet." 
"Phew... It's hot!$s" 
"Gah!$4#$b#...Um... What? Heh.. I don't know what that is...$3" 
"I love animals, Mr. @. If you treat yours well I'm sure we'll become good friends!^I just love animals, Ms. @. Treat them kindly and we'll become friends, I'm sure!" 
"Animals are so innocent, so sweet. And If I don't look after them, who will?$s#$e#I just hope my chickens aren't too upset when I take their eggs.$s" 
"You've been here a while, now... how's your farm doing?#$e#Taking care of animals is easy as long as you don't forget about them!$h" 
"Now that I'm here I can finally relax and socialize a bit." 
"There aren't very many people here today...$s" 
"I spilled a whole bucket of milk on the floor today, it was horrible. And such a waste of my poor Belinda's hard work.$k$s#$e#It's nice of you to show up! It's a little more lively now." 
"Phew! It sure feels good to kick back after a hard day's work." 
"*sigh*... I wasn't very productive today." 
"I always see Clint here but he won't talk to anyone. He just glances over his shoulder now and then.$s" 
"My nephew Shane has been staying at my place the last few months.#$e#He helps me out with the chickens, so I'm not complaining." 
"You can use a scythe to cut feed from grass.#$e#Or you can buy it from me, of course!$h#$e#I could use the cash...$u#$e#Adios." 
"Hi. Need something?#$e#I might be getting some different kinds of animals in the future.#$e#Although, I'll need to make sure there's a market for them, so you'll have to prove your skill with animals first.#$e#Just keep treating your animals with respect and good things will happen." 
"You can catch me at the saloon most nights.#$e#Animals are great company, but I need to spend time with people, too." 
"I think someone in town has taken a liking to me. *teehee*$k$h#$e#I would be so lonely if Shane ever moved out." 
"I wonder if Mr. Lewis gets lonely in that big house of his... $s#$e#It seems so empty in there, doesn't it?" 
"Have you been to that strange tower west of my house?#$e#One time I heard this terrible, otherworldly noise coming from there.$s#$e#I would avoid that place if I were you..." 
"Hey there, it's good to see ya!#$e#Feel free to visit us any time you please." 
"Hi @!$h#$e#I'm glad we've become friends. I know I can trust you to take care of my dear animals." 

"I tried my best, but my display is pretty weak compared to Pierre's.$s#$e#Well, maybe the judges will give me bonus points for the massive cheese wheel."
"Hi, @. Have you had a productive fall?#$e#It's starting to get quite cold... crops won't hold out for much longer."
"Welcome to the Egg Festival... complements of my wonderful brood of hens."
"Hens lay the eggs, but roosters play an important role, too... they protect the hens and prevent them from fighting with each other!#$b#That means happier hens and better eggs...$h"
"*sigh*... Love is in the air... And I'm still single.$s"
"If you brought something for the soup, climb the stairs on the other side and throw it in."
"That's a heavy load of people for an ancient wooden dock! I'll stay over here near the beach."
"Welcome to the Feast of the Winter Star!$h"
"I feel bad for all the poor, cold animals out there.$s"

"Why are you looking through my trash can?$s"

"I'm visiting the island today. If you need to buy anything, just leave the money in this box!^

"This is an incredible gift! Thanks!!/72 221 240 608/Thank you!/-5 -6 402 418/Oh. I guess I'll take it./16 152/This is worthless. I don't understand you./330/Thank you! This looks nice.//"

",^You're such a good neighbor I thought I'd send over some animal feed to make your job easier. Keep it up!

",^I now have rabbits in the animal shop! They will provide you with fluffy wool ...and more!
",^You've proven your ability to raise cows, so I'm now selling sheep at my shop!
",^I now have goats available for purchase at the animal shop. You've done well so far!
",^You've come a long way since you first arrived. As a result, I've decided to start selling pigs at my shop. These pigs are trained at finding gourmet truffles!
"Dear neighbor,^when I'm not taking care of animals I like to experiment in the kitchen. Since we've become friends I want to share some recipes with you.^I hope you like this!
"@,^I've got a new item in stock... It's called the \"Auto-Grabber\".^^This thing can milk your cows and goats, shear your sheep, gather eggs, and pluck your wooly rabbits... all on its own!^^It's considered a 'luxury item', so I'm charging 25,000g.
"Dear @,^I'd like to give my cows a special treat. They're such good girls and hungry, too. Could you bring me one bunch of amaranth? They love the stuff. ^Thanks, Dear.

"Shane?\"
"Oh dear...\"
"@... Can you do something? He's out cold.$s\"
"Shane! What's the matter with you? All you do anymore is mope around your room and drink beer!$s\"
"I'm worried...\"
"What's your plan? Don't you ever think about the future?\"

"Hi Shane... you look unusually happy today.\"
"Let me guess... Gus had a clearance sale on canned beer?$u\"
"He looks sharp!\"

"Hello @!$h#$b#You see this cat/dog here?\"
"I found it sitting outside the entrance to your farm! I think it's a stray... poor little thing.$s\"
"I think it likes this place! Hey, um.... Don't you think this farm could use a good cat/dog?$h\"
"Well, little %... You be a good kitty/pooch now... okay?\"

"Good morning, Mr. @!$h^Ms. @!$h#$b#I came by to ask you a favor, since you're such a kind neighbor.#$b#You see, I'm trying to train my goats to say 'hello'... but they simply won't pay attention to me unless I have their favorite treat, cave carrots!$u#$b#So... since I'm scared of the mines... I thought, well, maybe you would bring me a cave carrot when you have the chance?#$b#There's no pressure... but if you want to, just swing by my house between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM with a cave carrot. You'll make an old girl very happy. Bye.\"

"My goats go wild over cave carrot... I can't imagine why.\"

"Um... Leah? How much longer will this be?$s#$b#...My knees are quivering, my thighs are whimpering, and I've lost all sensation in my foot.$s\"
"Make me look good!\"
"Oooh!\"
"I love it! That's going up in my room...$h\"

"I do!\"
"Mmmm... % eggs.\"

"You care too much about your job, Lewis. There are other things to life, you know.$u\"
"...but yes, I understand. I guess we'll have to keep...us...a secret.$s\"
"Gahh!$4\"
"Why were you hiding there, anyway?$u\"

"Oh no... this doesn't look good.$s\"
"@? You'd better keep your eye on him... next time you catch him coming out of the Saloon, you should say something...$s\"
"Alright... we've caught him in the act. Now let's confront him. Take a deep breath... $s\"
"Shane... this is what you've been doing in here?$s\"
"But... these cans...$s\"

"Um... Haley? When do we stop? M... My legs... *pant* *pant*$s\"
"Yep\"

“Oohh... Fine purple silk. You can't find that at JojaMart!”

“That was some strange-looking purple lettuce in your grange display! I swear, It looked just like Mayor Lewis' special und... Oh!... heh... nevermind!”

“Erm... Doctor Harvey? This is completely confidential, right?”

“*sigh*... When the door opened I thought it might be Lewis.”
