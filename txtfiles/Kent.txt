"Hello, farmer.#$e#I've been gone so long... I feel like a stranger." 
"Hey, @. Nice to see you." 
"Time to head home." 
"Standing on this beach... I feel a rare sense of peace.$h#$e#The ocean is a very special thing." 
"This is a great place to bond with the family. I really appreciate you fixing it up." 
"Just getting some water." 
"The boat ride was fun. I even got to use some of my nautical training to help navigate.$h" 
"Erm... okay. Thank you. I'll meet you there.$h" 
"...!$4#$b#...Where did you find this?$4#$b#...$5#$b#This man... We fought together in the war, @. He was like a brother to me. #$b#But... only one of us made it back.$5#$b#He never lost his courage, though. Even in the face of death. A true hero... I'll never forget him.#$b#Thanks for bringing me this... It means a lot to me.#$b#Here, take this. It's been sitting in the back of our cupboard for years, and we've never used it." 
"Yep... It's been tightly sealed, so the flavor should still be really potent." 
"I don't know if I'll ever get used to being back home.#$e#The peacefulness of the town feels like a mask. That's probably just me though." 
"Things haven't changed much since I've been gone.#$e#Well, except that you're here." 
"Things haven't changed much since I've been gone.#$e#Except that we have a new farmer in town.$h" 
"...I lost a lot of friends in battle.$s#$e#What's sad is that I can't even remember their faces.#$e#..." 
"You've been here a while now, haven't you? Your farm must be thriving." 
"I've been up since 4 o'clock... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get back into a normal routine.$k#$e#Sam has really grown up since I left. He's a man now.#$e#I wish I could've been there for him.$s" 
"Are you friends with my son?#$e#You probably know him better than I do...$s" 
"Hey, @. Are you enjoying the married lifestyle?" 
"It looks like a decent day for fishing, doesn't it?" 
"Jodi tells me you've really become a part of this community. I'm glad to hear it." 
"I have trouble sleeping, so please excuse me if I seem tired.#$e#I'm sure you can understand." 
"I don't know what to do with myself now that I'm back.#$e#I'm used to having more structure in my day." 
"You keep quiet! Stop trying to turn me against my wife.$u" 
"...$s#$b#You're absolutely right, @.$s" 
"Don't lie to me! I hate lies more than anything!$u" 

"I'm waiting for this clown to start doing something funny.#$e#Pretty disappointing."
"Hey, @. Nice evening, isn't it?"
"I'm not a big fan of eggs, to tell you the truth."
"This open field... it makes me nervous.#$e#*whisper* Happy thoughts, Kent. Happy Thoughts."
"Hey, good to see you."
"Good evening, @. Hope you can find some time to relax before the harvest season."
"Good afternoon, @. Happy Feasting."
"I like winter. It's peaceful."

"Dear Farmer @,^I'd like to give my wife a starfruit for our anniversary. Are you growing any on your farm? If you brought me one, I'd be very grateful.

"Um, hello there. My name's Kent. I just got back last night... from overseas. My wife told me that a new farmer had moved in while I was gone.\"
"Well, I just wanted to introduce myself... I'll see you around.\"

"I'm happy for an excuse to get out of the house, and take my mind off things.\"

"Hi @. Please, come in.\"
"Heh heh.$h\"
