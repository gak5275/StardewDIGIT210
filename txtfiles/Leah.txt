"Hello, it's nice to meet you. $h#$e#You picked a good time to move here... The spring is lovely." 
"Don't tell anyone, but Willy let me steer the boat for a few minutes.$h" 
"Well, that was deeply relaxing." 
"I love the weather in Stardew Valley, but seeing a different climate now and then helps put things into perspective." 
"The shape of the waves here is awe inspiring.#$e#I wonder if I could ever capture that sort of formlessness in a sculpture." 
"I like the heat as long as I'm keeping perfectly still.$h" 
"Mmm, I bet the trees around here would make for an interesting medium to work with.#$e#Though Willy probably wouldn't be happy with me if I dragged a bunch of logs onto his ship!$h" 
"I wonder what kind of things you could forage out here.#$e#I think I saw some tasty looking walnuts growing on a bush nearby." 
"Have you tried the Piña Colada? I'm on my second one... hehe." 
"I'll be honest. I don't want to dance with you.$u" 
"I've realized I'm happier by myself. So just leave me be.$u" 
"Ohh... Got it. Hah... I really don't have any luck when it comes to this stuff...$s" 
"I don't want to see you for a while...$s" 
"You caused a lot of grief with what you did... but I'm ready to put the past behind us.$s" 
"I came for the sound of the ocean. Beautiful, isn't it?" 
"The trees look nice today, don't they? So why did you become a farmer?
"$p 21#So are you making as much money as you hoped?|Spending time in nature is very rewarding." 
"Hmm. That seems kind of shallow, doesn't it?$s" 
"That's pretty much the reason I came here, too!$h" 
"That's very sweet to honor your grandfather like that." 
"Hi. Oh, you want to talk?#$e#The landscape around here gives me a lot of ideas. The terrain is almost like a sculpture itself.#$e#I don't make art for money. It's just an urge that I have.#$e#Farming seems like a very rewarding profession. You get to create delicious food for everyone!$h#$e#You're probably busy. Sorry." 
"Hello, neighbor.#$e#We both live outside of town. Does that mean something?" 
"This morning I accidentally stepped on a bug.$s#$e#Sometimes I think it's impossible to live without destroying nature in some way." 
"I love being around animals. They're so innocent.#$e#Farm animals are wonderful, too.$h" 
"Hi @! I was just thinking about you and your farm.#$e#I was imagining how good it must feel to harvest a big bunch of crops.$h#$e#Wouldn't it be nice to have help, though?$l" 
"There's actually a lot of wild food in this area, if you know where to look.#$e#I've been having fresh salads almost every day.$h" 
"Foraging is a specialty of mine. Someday I'll make you a fresh salad.$h" 
"It's simpler to be friends with the trees. They don't have much to say.$h" 
"We wouldn't be able to survive without nature. It's good to remember that." 
"Hello, @. It's a nice day, isn't it?#$e#Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h" 
"I love to decorate for the different seasons." 
"Farming sounds so fun. I want to try it, someday.$l" 
"If you hear any banging from inside my hut, it's probably just me working on one of my sculptures." 
"If you ever find any interesting looking driftwood, I could use it.#$e#It would be special that you gave it to me.$l" 
"...What?$7#$b#Oh! Yeah, that's absolutely right!$h" 
"There's nothing wrong with that... I think there's lots of beauty to be found in raw, untouched nature!#$b#But as a human, I'm also interested in how we shape and interpret the world around us... I guess what I'm saying is that I'm interested in 'art'." 
"You pig!$a^Oh! You're...? Me too.$6#$b#Get out!$a^That's good to know.$l" 
"You're right... I just wouldn't have been happy back there.$u#$b#It was better for both of us... to end an unsustainable relationship while we were still young and flexible.$u" 
"That's a little harsh... but, yeah. We had different priorities.$u" 
"Oh yeah? Well maybe I'll just leave, then!$a" 
"*sigh*...$s#$b#I guess you're right... it was kind of selfish. But can you really blame me for wanting to be happy? Ugh... I don't know...$s" 
"*sigh*...$s#$b#Maybe you're right... Humans are selfish creatures. I don't know. $s#$b#I probably shouldn't dwell on it. We all have to make hard choices from time to time.$s" 
"You can tell it's summer by the sweet smell of nectar wafting through the air!$h" 
"I found some wild fruits this morning!#$e#Sorry, I don't have any left.$s#$e#Keep looking, I'm sure you'll find something." 
"The sound of farm animals is great, isn't it?" 
"The simple things in life are best; a soft summer breeze, majestic clouds, and a goblet full of Stardew Valley red." 
"I have a good eye for wild fruit. Some day I'll make you a nice fruit salad.$h" 
"You can use a tapper to harvest syrups and other useful liquids directly from trees.#$e#It's a slow process, but the result can be quite valuable." 
"I hate to be blunt, but if we don't treat nature with respect, our grandchildren will be doomed.#$e#Don't you think so?" 
"Hello, @. Do you ever get lonely on that big farm?#$e#Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h" 
"The flowing water keeps my house a little bit cooler in summer.#$e#I can't tolerate heat very well." 
"What should I do on such a warm, lazy day? *sigh*#$e#Any ideas?" 
"How quickly the seasons change!#$e#It's shocking." 
"#$c .5#I found some wild mushrooms over the weekend!#$e#I had a huge plate of wild mushrooms and eggs for breakfast today... I'm still full.#$e#Keep your nose to the ground and you'll find some mushrooms yourself... I'm sure of it." 
"I wonder if I could make a collage out of dried leaves?#$e#They're just so colorful... I can't help but think of the potential for art projects.$h" 
"Everyone has a unique and interesting perspective, whether they believe it or not. Don't you think so?#$e#Although, some people have opinions that I just can't respect." 
"It's so nice to live by the river.#$e#I fall asleep to the soothing sound of water every night." 
"One of these days I'll have to make you a wild mushroom stir-fry.$h" 
"Do you have a kitchen in your house?#$e#If you have a kitchen, you can cook all kinds of delicious meals.$h" 
"Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.$h" 
"Decorations accentuate the feeling of the season. I think it's a worthwhile tradition." 
"There's a lot of good places to walk around here.#$e#It feels good to stretch your legs." 
"I love the way everything looks when it's covered with fresh snow." 
"It gets pretty cold in my little cabin.$s#$e#I just snuggle up under a huge blanket, and I'm okay.$h" 
"I saw a snow rabbit early this morning! They're rare, aren't they?" 
"I'm having a hard time finding fresh food to eat.#$e#I've been eating a lot of bread.$s" 
"*Sigh*... It's hard to get fresh food in the winter.#$e#I bet your farm is pretty well stocked with food, huh?" 
"Time seems to move slower here.#$e#When I lived in the city, the year went by so fast." 
"Do you ever get cold in that farmhouse of yours?#$e#Stop by my cabin if you want to huddle under one of my quilts and drink cider.$h" 
"Hello. Do you want something?" 
"Hello, @. Is there something you wanted to talk about?" 
"Do you ever take a whole day off?#$e#It's a refreshing break." 

"I sometimes find inspiration in the most unlikely of places." 
"I used to find rain depressing when I lived in the city. But here in Stardew Valley it's beautiful." 
"Good morning! I got up early and did some mushroom hunting. Here, take one.[281 404 420 257]#$e#Searching for mushrooms is like going on a treasure hunt. It's a lot of fun.$h" 
"It's days like this I'm really happy about my heavy-duty boots.$h" 
"The trees have been begging for this rain... I'm happy for them." 
"How was your day? Did you see any animals out there?" 
"Don't look too close, it's a work in progress." 
"I usually go for salad... but a wet night like this gives me cravings for hot soup.$h" 
"It's going to be relaxing to fall asleep on a night like this...$l" 
"I made a little wood sculpture today, but it was so ugly I threw it into the fire.$u#$e#I think to become a great artist, you have to be critical of your own work." 
"I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to get under the covers and stay warm." 
"How was your day today, dear? Muddy?" 
"This house is a lot nicer than my old cabin! I don't miss it." 
"Good morning, @. I've planted these in a little pot out back... [16 18 20 22 90 259 396 402]#$e#I grew that with great love and attention. Enjoy it." 
"Always remember to keep your eyes peeled for wild food! There's lots out there." 
"I was thinking... life's too short to eat bad food. Luckily, we live in one of the best regions for fresh greens and vegetables!#$e#Here, I made you a healthy salad. [196]#$e#I'm surprised you aren't sick of my salad yet!" 
"Good morning, @! I made us some coffee.[395]$h#$e#My morning just wouldn't be complete without a hot cup of coffee." 
"Something about this time of night makes me thirsty." 
"The flow of time is so delicate... even the tiniest decision changes the future forever." 
"It's so much lovelier here at night than the garish glow of the city.#$e#Everything worked out perfectly for me. I'm very lucky." 
"I never thought I'd receive a mermaid's pendant so soon after moving here! I'm happy about it, though.$l" 
"I saw a wild rabbit today. I just wish I could pet one someday. They look so soft..." 
"The cool breeze feels nice. It reminds me of living by the river." 
"Hmm... I'm going to do some maintenance over here. I just get the urge to do some hammering now and then." 
"It's going to be a special day, I can sense it." 
"Ah... that smell of fresh dirt. There's nothing quite like it.$h#$e#You can just tell the air is clean here... it feels good in the lungs." 
"Don't overwork yourself, dear.#$e#Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.$h" 
"I'm going to take a nature walk today. I need to get out of the house." 
"I had a nice, relaxing time today. How did your day go?" 
"It's fun to be a parent. I want to make sure 1 grows up to have a love for the outdoors." 
"We've got a wonderful farm and a full family. Our new life has really turned out well, hasn't it?" 
"Living here, I feel like I'm on the summit of a great mountain." 
"Did I ever tell you... when you first moved here I had a dream that we'd be together someday." 
"Sometimes it's hard not to believe in destiny... the fact that I decided to move here, and that we found each other.#$b#It could've gone entirely differently at any point." 
"Wow, you look full of energy today!$l^You look beautiful today.$l" 
"Mmm... You smell nice today." 
"I was just admiring my wedding amulet... I'll cherish this treasure for the rest of my life.$l" 
"Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry about you falling into a mine shaft." 
"@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household.$h" 
"Don't worry about me... I know you've got a lot of responsibilities outside of the house. I'm fine in here by myself!$l" 
"Oh, I'm not bored... I'm just enjoying what we have here.#$e#It's a simple life, but I like it.$h" 
"I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and gray." 
"I wonder who lived here before us?" 
"Don't you have anything to do today?" 
"If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me." 
"I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time." 
"Are we doing okay on money, @?" 
"I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?" 
"I don't really feel like doing anything today." 
"No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.#$e#I guess farms can be kind of dirty." 
"I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?" 
"...Do you still love me?$s" 
"*sigh*... Maybe we got married too young.$s" 
"Are you still happy with me?s" 
"Did I do something wrong? You've been acting different lately.$s" 
"Do you ever wonder what else is out there?$s" 
"You used to be romantic... what happened?$s#$e#I know I'm not as young as I used to be... is that what you married me for?$a" 
"We only have one short life to live... is this the best way to do it?$s" 
"I used to be your sweetie... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.$s" 
"You've been so cold to me lately...$s" 
"I wonder if I could've done better.$s" 
"So, what are we planting this season?" 
"That was some way to ring in the new year last night...$l" 
"*sigh*... I guess it's time for the 'spring cleaning' again.$s" 
"Ah, summer... I can smell the spice berries already.$h" 
"Sorry if I'm wet to the touch... I was sweating all night in the heat." 
"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.#$e#Don't worry, I'll take care of them." 
"I love fall for the mushroom hunting opportunities. It comes and goes pretty fast." 
"Have you planned for winter at all? It's good to have a stockpile of hay." 
"I know harvest season is a busy time for you. I'll try and help out as much as I can." 
"Winter's here, and that means crystal fruit is in season. It has such a unique flavor, don't you think?" 
"I'm looking forward to carving ice sculptures tomorrow. I only get to do it once a year, but it's a lot of fun!" 
"Hey, here's to another great year at  farm! Let's have some fun tonight! [348]$h#$e#Next year is going to be great, I can feel it." 

"I learned all of Robin's techniques last year, but she's always one step ahead of me!"
"I really admire Robin's carpentry skills. I use a lot of the same techniques in my own line of work."
"I may have had a little too much pumpkin ale..."
"Mm, hi. Sorry... mouth full of blackberries."
"I never had many friends in town, so these events are always kind of boring for me. I enjoy the buffet, though."
"Mmmm... This fruit punch is unusually good.$h"
"Hmm... The punch isn't as good as last year. It's missing something!"
"Hi @. Glad to see you here.$h"
"It's nice to see everyone once in a while, but mostly I want to get back to the farm."
"How's the farming coming along? It must be a busy season for you."
"Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. I'll come meet up with you when we launch the candle-boat."
"Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. "
"Oh, ice. A beautiful material to sculpt in, but so impermanent.#$e#But I guess that might make the art even better."
"I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm.$h"
"Gus was just telling me about his artisan candy canes. *yawn*$u#$e#I think he had too much cinnamon nog."

"...I'm a little nervous. But happy.$h"
"I've always dreamed of living on a farm.$h#$e#I'm going to be so happy."

"The other day I bought {1} {2} at Pierre's. It was perfect on a bed of greens and a dash of my 'special' vinaigrette."

"I think we've both found what we were looking for in this place.#$b#I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, but here with you.$l"

"Might want to do some fishing or mining today, huh?"
"How was your day today, dear? Muddy?"
"Mind if I add some architectural flair to the woodwork around here? My chisel hand is itching!"
"It's so quiet and peaceful in the evening. Nothing to distract you from the experience of living."
"Wow, this is great! I'm really starting to enjoy life on the farm, @.$h#$e#This is the life I've always dreamed of.
"Don't forget to look for wild horseradish, leeks and dandelions while you're out there!"
"Nothing pairs so well with summer like a nice sweet wine. Don't you think, honey?"
"Breathe deep... can you smell that? That tells me it's mushroom season."
"I always start craving salad in the winter... Inconvenient, I know."
One of these days I'll have to do your portrait.#$e#The view from this window is inspiring, don't you think?"

"Oh! This is exactly what I wanted! Thank you!/196 200 348 606 651 650 426 430/This is a really nice gift! Thank you!/-5 -6 -79 -81 18 402 169 406 408 418 86/Hmm... I guess everyone has different tastes./-2 2 152 330 221 223 229 232 233 241 209 194/This is a pretty terrible gift, isn't it?/305 211 210 206 216/Thank you.

That was great! It's a new honky-tonk classic!|Nice work, guys!
Good job!

"Dear @,^Thanks again for coming to my art show. It was such a success! I sold nearly all of my sculptures, and everyone was so positive and encouraging! I hope to see you again soon.

"Maybe I should cook something new and exciting today. Something spicy."

“Hmmm... a Lupini original? Not bad...”

Hi @! Are you free this afternoon?#$b#I finally got my act together and I'm doing my art show tonight in the town square!$h#$b#Come into town between 3:00 and 5:00 pm if you want to be there!\I'm nervous...$l\Hi, @.

I knew you'd be passing through here today.#$b#...So I put together a surprise...$h\It's a little picnic for us!$h\This is a vegetable medley, with my 'special' spice blend.\...and this is a fresh salad, made from greens that I foraged right here in the forest!$h\@, um...$l\I just want to say thank you... for helping me get one step closer to becoming a real artist.$l\Kel??$6#$b#What the heck are you doing here?$a\Yuck, don't call me that!$a#$b#You never supported my art before... now that I've had some success you want me back? You make me sick.$a\Oh my God!$6\Well, he'll make it... but that was pretty violent, @.^She's fine... but that was pretty violent, @.\Let's get out of here. I don't think Kel will be bothering us anymore.\Let's find a more secluded spot this time...$l\Well, the picnic didn't pan out like I wanted it to.$h\You're 'Mr. K'? I...

No squirming!$h\Hey, @... what style do you think I should do? I'm up for anything...\Stick with the classic look, huh? Yeah, I think Marnie will appreciate that.\Good idea! That sounds fun... Let me get some more yellow paint on the palette...\Hmm... not my usual style, but I'll give it a shot. I'd better switch to acrylic paint for this one...\How's yours coming along?\Wow, I like your confidence!$h#$b#Who knows? Maybe you'll become the next Lupini!$h#$b#...Can't wait to see it.\Hey, that's all I ask. If you keep trying your best you can't help but get better at it!\Hey, that's okay! You gotta start somewhere. And you never know, one person's chicken scratch is another person's 'modern art'\Shh!\Now, don't forget the techniques I taught you... broad strokes, hold the brush like so...\There!\What do you think?\Now, let's see what you've got, @.\Erm... It's... interesting!$6#$b#It's, uh... a different kind of approach, for sure...$6\Marnie, you can hang both of these in your room!$h\Um... Honey?

You're horrible...$a\That's right!\Absolutely.$a\Absolutely.$a\Absolutely.$a\Oh, hi @! Come in, come in.\I'm just working on this sculpture here.\Come here. Watch this.\See that? I'm revealing the essence of the wood.\$q Once you get past the outer layers, the true nature starts to show...I first visited this valley as a little girl, while on vacation with my parents.#$b#I knew I had to come back some day... This place has great artistic potential!\Although, I have to admit... It's not easy to pay the bills as an artist.$s\Hmmm... interesting. I guess that could set the wheels in motion to making Pelican Town a true art destination...$7\But what if no one likes my sculptures? I'd be crushed.$s\...I'll have to think about it.$s\Well, thanks for stopping by, @.\Hmm... I guess that's an idea... But I'd need a computer first.$7\And again... that's expensive.$s\Well, it was nice of you to visit...\Kel...How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want to come back to the city!$8#$b#Stop calling me... I don't want to hear from you anymore! *click*$8\@...$6\So I guess you heard me yelling on the phone?$s\That was my ex...$s\I guess I'd better tell you a little about it...$u\We had an apartment together, back in the city.$u#$b#I did odd jobs during the day and spent all night working on art projects... we barely made enough to scrape by.$u#$b#He was always nagging me to go back to school and study business or medicine... something with a lot of money in it.$a^She was always nagging me to go back to school and study business or medicine... something with a lot of money in it.$a#$b#I guess the idea was to save up for a normal life. You know... a house in the suburbs, kids, PTA meetings... that sort of thing.$u\I wasn't ready for that kind of life, @... I had to leave. So I came here to pursue my dream of being an artist.\$q #Was that selfish of me, @?Well, thanks for listening to me. It's good to have a friend.\Hey! Come check this out.\I bought a laptop and set up an online art shop... like you suggested.\Did you hear that? That means someone just bought something from the store!$h\Hmm... There's this 'Mr. K' that keeps buying all my sculptures.$7#$b#I guess it must be some rich guy who loves my stuff.\Wow! I'm not going to have to worry about my electricity bill for a while after that sale...$6\Anyway... Thanks for giving me this idea, @. So far, it's been really successful! This is really going to give me the funding I need to keep working on art full-time.$h\Now, sorry to ignore you... but I really need to tweak these CSS sheets...$7\Sorry... I shouldn't get angry.$s\Maybe you're right... my life would've been a lot easier if I had stayed.$u#$b#Maybe it's better to be practical and realistic... for all I know my art career will never pan out and I'll live my final years in squalor.$s\Well, thanks for listening to me. It's good to have a friend.\So I've been saving up money to buy a computer... You know, so I can try and sell my art online like you suggested.\It's good to have a friend looking out for you!\Anyway... I've been thinking a little more about that art show idea you had.#$b#I'm working on some new sculptures to display at the show... I'm nervous, but the thought of getting my work out there is pretty exciting.#$b#I'm just glad you're on board with making Stardew Valley a premier art destination, @!$h\@! You're here!$h#$b#Okay... I guess I'd better introduce my pieces. Wish me luck!$l\Umm... Okay everyone!\Thanks for coming to my art show.$l\As some of you know, I came to this town because I wanted to draw inspiration from the beautiful surroundings.\This place really feels like home now.$h#$b#Okay. I'm going to introduce my sculptures now.\I haven't named this one, yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her through to completion.#$b#Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide.\This one's called 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human imagination.$u#$b#The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance state'.\I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to a physical entity. \And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood.\Well, those are my sculptures!$l#$b#Oh! One last thing.\I'd like to say thanks to my special friend, @.#$b#He gave me the idea for this show and the courage to go through with it. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.^She Thanks, everyone!$h\Wow! I'm exhausted.#$b#My show was a real success, wasn't it?$h\
