        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Stardew Valley has a few overarching themes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appreciation of nature</li>
            <li>Connection with local community</li>
            <li>Escaping the rush of "modern life" (as the game puts it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Questions we would like to answer by analyzing the game's text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To what extent are these themes represented in the game's dialogue?</li>
            <li>Which characters embody these themes the most? Which ones embody them the
                least?</li>
            <li>Are there any other themes consistently present throughout the dialogue?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How we will analyze the text of Stardew Valley:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the word usage of each character and identify recurring themes</li>
            <li>Create a network of connections and relationships between the characters</li>
            <li>Identify which locations in the game certain characters appear together</li>
        </ul>
