        <h3>About the Game</h3>
        <p><b>Stardew Valley</b> is a life simulation video game in which the player moves to a
            small rural community to work on their grandfather's old farm. The game was created by
            Eric Barone (known online as ConcernedApe) and originally released <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">for PC via
                Steam</a> on February 26, 2016. It has since released <a
                href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stardew-valley/id1406710800">on</a>

        <h3>Our Research Questions</h3>
        <p>Stardew Valley has a few overarching themes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appreciation of nature</li>
            <li>Connection with local community</li>
            <li>Escaping the rush of "modern life" (as the game puts it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We aim to answer the following questions through our analysis of the game's text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To what extent are these themes represented in the game's dialogue?</li>
            <li>Which characters embody these themes the most? Which ones embody them the
                least?</li>
            <li>Are there any other themes consistently present throughout the dialogue?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How we will analyze the text of Stardew Valley:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the word usage of each character and identify recurring themes</li>
            <li>Create a network of connections and relationships between the characters</li>
            <li>Identify which locations in the game certain characters appear together</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features of the Site</h3>
        <p>On our website we have featured details about the text corpora we woked with, our
            methodology for conducting our analysis, and some visualizations of our findings.
            Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>In regards to our original goals for this project, our intent on analyzing the central
            themes of Stardew Valley (those of nature and community) largely fell by the wayside. We
            may not have ended up analyzing those aspects of the game, but we did look at how
            emotionally positive or negative the game's text was overall. We found that the game has
            a largely positive outlook. Anyone who has played Stardew Valley and has gotten to know
            its characters knows that the game has some dark moments and many characters deal with
            serious personal issues like depression or the loss of a loved one. However, many of
            them are making an effort to work through their issues and make the best out of their
            situations.</p>
        <p>The rest of our findings were largely quantitative rather than qualitative. We networked
            each of the characters to the locations that they appear throughout the game. By doing
            this, we found out which locations are visited by the most characters and which
            characters appear in the most locations. We also developed a graph showing the pecentage
            of lines of dialogue in the game that are spoken by each character. The character with
            the most lines had 5.159 percent of them, and the character with the least lines had
            0.02 percent of them.</p>
        <p>While our results may not be what we were originally intending to look for, they were at
            least interesting for those who have played Stardew Valley and allowed us to make some
            fun inferences about our findings. If we had more time, we would have liked to look at
            the dialogue and word usage more closely to identify recurring themes. We would have
            also liked to network the connections of the characters to eachother, instead of just to
            the locations they appear in. Perhaps this project could be picked up by another group
            in a future DIGIT class who can analyze the game even further than we did.</p>
