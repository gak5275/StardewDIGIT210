        <h3>About the Game</h3>
        <p><b>Stardew Valley</b> is a life simulation video game in which the player moves to a
            small rural community to work on their grandfather's old farm. The game was created by
            Eric Barone (known online as ConcernedApe) and originally released for PC via Steam on
            February 26, 2016. It has since released on many different platforms and sold over 10
            million copies.</p>
        <h3>Our Research Questions</h3>
        <p>Stardew Valley has a few overarching themes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appreciation of nature</li>
            <li>Connection with local community</li>
            <li>Escaping the rush of "modern life" (as the game puts it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We aim to answer the following questions through our analysis of the game's text:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To what extent are these themes represented in the game's dialogue?</li>
            <li>Which characters embody these themes the most? Which ones embody them the
                least?</li>
            <li>Are there any other themes consistently present throughout the dialogue?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How we will analyze the text of Stardew Valley:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look at the word usage of each character and identify recurring themes</li>
            <li>Create a network of connections and relationships between the characters</li>
            <li>Identify which locations in the game certain characters appear together</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features of the Site</h3>

            methodology for conducting our analysis, and some visualizations of our findings.
