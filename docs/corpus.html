        <h2>Text Corpus</h2>
        <h3>Finding the Text</h3>
        <p>When seeking out the text of Stardew Valley, we first looked online to see if the game's full script was available. We could not find it, so we had to look within the files of the game itself. One of us downloaded the PC version of the game and began exploring its files. We found that all of the files that contained in-game text each had 12 or so different variations, one for each language option the game has. The English versions of these files were what we were looking for. However, not all of the text in the game is character dialogue, so we also had to figure out which of these files contained dialogue and which did not. This took some trial and error, but we eventually found most of files we needed. There are at least a few lines of dialogue we are aware of that we unfortunately could not find in the files. These were the filepaths that contained most of the files with dialogue:</p>
        <p>Stardew Valley > Content > Characters > Dialogue</p>
        <p>Stardew Valley > Content > Data</p>
        <p>Stardew Valley > Content > Data > Events</p>
        <p>Stardew Valley > Content > Data > Festivals</p>
