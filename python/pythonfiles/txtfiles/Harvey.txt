"You look a little soggy, hun. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?^You look a little soggy, dear. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?" 
"The sound of rain gives our minds something to focus on, so we're not distracted by random thoughts.#$e#That's my theory for why it's so soothing..."

"I took it easy today... spent some time reading books, fiddled with my radio, and worked on a model airplane.#$e#It's important to take a day off now and then to relax... stress is unhealthy." 
"Good evening... did you finish everything you needed to do today?#$e#Don't worry about me. I'm very self-sufficient. If you have more work to do go right ahead." 
"It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as  Farm." 
"Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem."

"So far, I really like being a father!$h" 
"I already gave 1 and 2 their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!" 
"I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once." 
"Maybe 2 will grow up to become a pilot, like I never could?" 
"My life is devoted to you and the children now, and I'm very happy about it. I always dreamed of having a wonderful family.$l#$e#I had nightmares of being a bachelor forever.... I love you so much.$l"

"Be careful out there! I have nightmares about your limp body being wheeled into the emergency room.$7" 
"I think I'll take a little walk today. I need to unwind." 
"I had a nice day. It's refreshing to spend some time alone now and then. Did you have a good day, honey?" 
"It's wonderful to see all the plants return to life. The greenery is refreshing after a monochrome winter." 
"Oh, it's a festival tomorrow, isn't it? Large crowds, activities... *gulp*$s" 
"W...Will you dance with me at the festival tomorrow?$7#$e#It's always a little embarrassing.$7"

"Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup?#$e#I would put an item of high value and quality. We all want to leave a great impression on the governor!"

"Make sure and diversify your harvests this fall, my dear.#$e#Or just grow cranberries... It's really up to you. What do I know?" 
"Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while.$h" 
"I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave." 
"The air is very dry during winter. That's why our skin tends to become irritated.#$e#Don't worry, I'll rub a little truffle oil onto your back every night.$l" 
"Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? I do enjoy the igloos..." 
"Well, here's to a fantastic year. I have complete confidence that next year will be even better!$h" 

"I'll wait here until you're ready to go home..."
"And just a few steps over there, Gus is grilling up a batch of pork ribs... Yikes.$s#$e#I've got some soul-searching to do...$11"
"Hi... I was hoping you'd find me here...$l"
"Oh! You found me...$8#$b#The truth is, I got too scared so I came here to hide. Don't tell anyone.$s"
"How is everyone doing? I'm just taking a break for a little while. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the egg hunt!"
"Eggs definitely have a place in the well-balanced diet.#$e#Oops... I should take off my Doctor's hat for the time being.$11"
"Eggs are fine, but I'd advise against eating thirty per day!"
"I'm working up the courage to ask someone to dance with me.$11"
"Oh dear... I've got sand in my socks...$s"
"Good thing I came with sunscreen.#$e#I wonder if Maru could use some sunscreen on her shoulders?"
"Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!"
"I'm dreaming of our warm fire back home...$l"
"Extreme temperatures can put your body under a lot of stress, so make sure to bundle up!#$e#Oh, and enjoy the festival!$h"
"I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air...$l"
"I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!"

"Oh my goodness! I have so much to prepare before the wedding! I'm nervous.$l#$e#I'll be relieved after we're all settled in on your farm.$h"
"I'm really happy.$h#$e#This was always my secret wish.$l"

"When I'm next to you, I'm not even scared of falling off this cliff and dashing onto the sharp rocks below...
I... I love and admire you very much, @...

"Make sure you stay dry today, dear. I don't want you to become hypothermic."
"Hi. It's good to see you.$h#$e#I spent the day skimming through some medical journals."
"The sky looks great today... so clear!#$e#From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home!"
"You look like you could use a good massage tonight.$l#$e#Doctor's orders... It's good for the circulation!"
"This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day.$l#$e#I love watching you on the farm... hehe"
"I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?"
"#$c .5#Hi, honey. How was your day?#$e#*Phew*... I'm exhausted...$s#$e#My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day."
"Let's plant some healthy vegetables this spring.$h"
"Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin."
"I could sure go for some wine."
"Winter is flu season, so work is probably going to be a lot more stressful. Sorry in advance if I'm grouchy."
No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it's still fun to break out the equipment now and then.#$e#I'm working on a new model plane. It's so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment.

"Hi @! Er... Read anything interesting in the library lately?#$e#Heh. Well, um... I'll see you around then?$u"

Needs salt...
It's burning!
Hmm...
A little bit of this...
Some of this...
Presto!
Ah... You're right on time, @!$h#$b#Let me just set the table...
You've been working so hard on the farm... I wanted to make you a special dinner.
It's my very own 'angel hair pasta primavera'... with clams!
Heavenly, huh? That must be the 'angel hair'!$h#$b#I'm glad you like it! You deserve the best.
Oh yes, I forgot to mention... it's 'whole wheat' pasta. And it's brimming with fresh vegetables.#$b#It's important that you eat healthy food! I want you to live forever...
Oh... I see. I knew I needed to add more salt.$s#$b#Well, at least you'll be well hydrated.
Oh... I thought I gave myself the burnt one.$s#$b#Um, I lost track of one the pans and it caught fire... Sorry, dear.
Uhhh...! Heh. I guess a piece of my moustache may have fallen into the pasta...$8#$b#Well! Extra fiber, right? Heh... (sorry honey)
Oh! Eh... Must've been the truffle oil I drizzled on top...$8#$b#You meant delicious, edible fungus... right honey? Of course... Heh.
So, tell me about your day...
Yes, I can still see the dirt in your hair! I really appreciate all the hard work you do, honey.
That sounds dangerous... are you sure that's safe?$8#$b#I don't want to see you on the operating table anytime soon...$s#$b#Although I have to say, I like how courageous you are...
A peaceful day by the water, huh? That sounds very relaxing.#$b#I'm glad you're having fun out there!
Ah, that's good. Having an active social life is healthy for the brain.#$b#But remember, I'm always here for you if you need someone to talk to!
That makes sense. There's lots to do in this valley! ...And I know how hard you work.#$b#Just remember to take breaks! When you're so busy, it's easy to get burnt out from exhaustion.
Ah... I have that problem, too. The boundary between days can blur together... it's hard to keep track of everything!
Took the day off, huh? I'm glad to hear it.#$b#Well, with a day off and a hearty dinner you'll be fully re-charged for tomorrow.
Whew... I'm stuffed! That was great...
I'll take care of the dishes...
Don't feel bad... I like to do nice things for you! It makes me happy.
I know I say this a lot, but... marrying you was the best thing that ever happened to me!
That was filling. I'm gonna sleep well...

...I've pumped his stomach and re-hydrated his body. He's going to be okay.#$b#It's good that you brought him in, though.
Too much alcohol is terrible for the body... but right now I'm most worried about his mental health...$s#$b#When he comes to, I'll have a chat with him about his treatment options. I know an excellent counselor in Zuzu City...
Life can be painful, sometimes...#$b#But there's always hope for a better future. You've got to believe in that.

Sorry I'm all disheveled... I didn't know you were coming over.
Hey, I think I hear a plane overhead...
@, get over here!
Look!
As a kid, my dream was always to be a pilot.
...But with my bad eyesight and a crippling fear of heights, that dream started to fade away.
It's okay... don't be sad.#$b#I've grown to accept my station in life. Not everyone can achieve their dreams... that's just the way the world is.
Hey, let me show you my model airplanes. I just finished the new TR-Starbird deluxe set.

What happened? I heard something break.
You shouldn't blame others for your own problems, Maru.
*sigh*... I'll have to call the patient back in to recollect this sample.$s#$b#This'll probably put us in the red for another month...
Thanks for telling me the truth, Maru.#$b#Don't worry about the sample, we'll just get another one.
Of course... you've been a big help around here. I don't know what I'd do without you!
@? You look a little pale... are you feeling okay?

Ah, @! I was just about to write you a letter.
You see, my records indicate that you're due for your annual checkup!
Now, now... There's no need to worry. It'll be quick and painless. Please follow me.
Hmm... Okay. Hold still, please.
Say 'ahhh...'
Okay, you can stop.
I just need to check your vitals.
Hmm... Your pulse is high.
Well, then! You seem very healthy, @.#$b#Just make sure not to overwork yourself on that farm!
Thanks for stopping in.

Hello? Hello? Is anyone out there?
This is Dr. H at... 52 North 43.5 East... Seeking aerial response...Anyone out there?
Someone's there!?$10#$b#Er... I mean!... Standard ground report: Wind at 3 Clicks, 36 Degrees North of West. Ground Temperature at 42 Kraggs. Humidity 53%. Dr. H out!
Yikes, my pulse is soaring...
@!
Ah, well... You see, I was just on my radio here... and I made contact with a real pilot!
As a matter of fact, we can probably see him flying overhead right now!
Quick, get over here!

Someone found you unconscious and battered... I had to perform an emergency surgery on you!#$b#Be a little more careful next time, okay?

Okay, George. I want you take a deep breath for me.
Mmhmm... turn around, please.
George, I'll be honest with you. You need to make some changes in your lifestyle if you want to stay healthy.#$b#I'd like you to reduce your sodium intake, and try to get some moderate exercise with your arms.
I'm your doctor, George. That's who I am...#$b#And I went to school for 8 years so I could learn how to help people stay healthy.
Oh!#$b#I'm sorry, but you shouldn't be here... these check-ups are supposed to be private.
Very well...
@, what do you think George should do?
Thanks for your help, @. I appreciate it.$h|It's better not to give my patients mixed messages, @. Please remember that in the future.

There you are... just in time!
Look, here it comes!
I saw an ad in the paper for these balloon rides and I knew I had to surprise you with one.
Okay... you first.
We... We're up so high... *gulp*
I wanted to impress you with this... but look at me. I'm a trembling coward.
Well, you've got more than enough courage to make up for me, @... that's... that's part of why I like you.
Okay, I'm going to open my eyes and look down... don't let go of my hand.
I... I think I can do it now.
Hey, this is incredible! I think I can see Mayor Lewis standing in the town square!
Oh dear... our time's almost up.
Um... @? We've known each other for a while now and... I... er...
...
Whoops... Our time was up half an hour ago. We'd better touch down.
I haven't had such a wonderful day for as long as I can remember.
I am... yeah.$s#$b#But I'm determined to not let that stop me from doing what I want... and experiencing this with you.$l#$b#I'll try not to get scared.

You showed up just in time for the first ever Pelican Town 8-ball tournament!

You tricked all of us into thinking we loved you...$s^@... I thought you wanted to get married and start a family with me... What did I do wrong?
...yes.
That's not going to work! You won't be preying on our sympathies this time!

*pant*...*pant*...Yes.
@! You were watching me?$8#$b#...How embarrassing... I didn't want anyone to know. Least of all you.
I'm just trying to stay healthy. As you get older, it requires more effort.#$b#I'm not in very good shape, though... I can hardly keep up with them.
Look... Don't tell everyone in town that I'm doing dance aerobics, okay?
Wow, that was quite a workout...

“Now just hold still... Take a deep breath for me.”

“Oh! I'm sorry... I, er... have plans to ask someone else.”

“I've been looking forward to it all afternoon! You look radiant in the fresh spring air, my dear.”
