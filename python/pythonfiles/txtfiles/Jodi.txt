"Oh! You aren't exactly how I imagined... but that's okay! I'm Jodi.#$e#It's a quiet little town, so it's very exciting when someone new moves in! Having a farmer around could really change things." 
"What a treat!" 
"I think I'll make seafood tonight.$h" 
"The view is breathtaking! Deep blue as far as the eye can see..." 
"We all love it when Gus shows up." 
"What's this? It looks like one of Kent's buddies from the war. Maybe you should show it to him?" 
"Maintaining a household is difficult work... but somebody has to do it.#$e#Yes?" 
"It's nice to have a family... but I'd be lying if I said I never miss the freedom of being young...$s" 
"My husband Kent is a soldier, working overseas. That's why he's not here right now.#$b#I know he'll come back safe once his tour is over!!#$e#Need something?" 
"Exercise is important for staying healthy. I always make sure to set aside some time for it.#$e#As a parent, I don't have much time to devote to myself. So I try and make every minute count." 
"I wish I could spend more time outside, but there's so much work to do.#$e#I started wearing rubber gloves to keep my hands soft.#$e#The older you get, the more work you have to do to stay healthy.$s#$e#Ok, bye!" 
"What did you say? It's already? My goodness!#$e#I still have tons of work to do!$s" 
"Where does all the time go? *sigh*#$e#I remember when Sam was a little baby wearing diapers. He was such a cute little kid.$s#$e#Don't tell him I said that.$h#$e#You must really like talking to me, huh?" 
"So you're a farmer, huh? Interesting.#$c .5#I've never met a farmer before.$k#$e#Maybe some day you can teach me how to grow vegetables.$h" 
"The food at JojaMart might not be the healthiest for my family, but with such low prices you'd be crazy to shop anywhere else!|The food at Pierre's is so much fresher and healthier than anything I ever bought at JojaMart. I do miss those cheap Joja prices, though." 
"Hi.#$e#Need something?" 
"I'm so glad you're trying to improve that old farm.#$e#Once you've got everything in order, it's going to add a lot to our community!$h#$e#It's going to be a lot of work for you, though.#$e#Bye." 
"Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to give thanks for my husband's safe return.|Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to ask for my husband's safe return.#$e#I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard sometimes.$s" 
"#$c .5#I'm taking a break from house chores today.$h#$e#I'm taking the day off.$h#$e#If I don't spend any time outside, I'll go crazy!#$e#Plus I don't want my legs to turn soft." 
"I had a dream that I had complete freedom, no obligation to anyone but myself...#$b#...Then I woke up and realized I had a full day of house chores ahead of me...$s#$e#But I don't regret having a family, @... Sam and Vincent mean everything to me!" 
"Summer is nice, but it also means more work.#$e#I'll have to keep the garden in shape on top of working in the house!" 
"Hello.#$e#Do you need something? I'm a little busy." 
"How's my little Sammy doing on the old farm?$h" 
"Housework is frustrating because you're never finished.#$e#The day after I sweep the floor, it's dirty again." 
"What in the world am I going to make for dinner?#$e#*sigh*..." 
"Maybe I've spoiled the boys a bit. They've never had to do any chores.#$e#I guess I want them to be able to enjoy their childhood while they still can. Well, Sam's basically a man now, though.#$b#I hope he hasn't grow up to be lazy. That won't do.$s#$e#Being a parent isn't very easy." 
"Is Sam just bumming around the farm, or is he contributing?" 
"Caroline and I are good friends. I tell her everything." 
"When you become a parent, you have to leave your old lifestyle behind.#$e#Maybe that's not entirely true... but if you're not careful, it will happen." 
"I loved playing in the snow when I was a kid. The great thing about being a mother is that I get to enjoy it again.$h" 
"Hi. Do you get tired of people asking about your farm all the time?#$e#I think I would." 
"*sigh*... Sometimes I dream about life on my own... without a family to look after. Is that horrible?$s#$e#Don't tell anyone.$4" 
"What do I do for fun? Hmm... That's a good question.#$e#I like sleeping.$s" 
"Kent has been home for a while now, but he still seems uneasy.$s" 
"Sam makes a lot of noise with that music of his. I hope it doesn't disturb the neighbors." 
"How's Sam doing? I have to admit, there's less cooking and cleaning to do since he moved out..." 
"We kind of rushed into our marriage, with Kent being a soldier and all... I hardly got a taste of youth and freedom, and now it's too late to ever go back.$s#$e#I can't believe I'm saying this to you.$4" 
"It would be nice to take a vacation once in a while...$s" 
"If I was rich the first thing I'd do would be to hire a maid and a chef.#$e#My goodness, that would be nice!$h" 

"He doesn't look very happy... I guess Mayor Lewis had to cut costs with a budget clown this year."
"Vincent's upset that I won't let him go into the haunted maze... but he's just a little boy!"
"Vincent loves this festival... it's a joy to see him so happy."
"Kent always seems a little antsy during big gatherings like this..."
"Are you going to be dancing today, @?$h"
"I hope the soup is good this year."
"There! I just saw something glowing!#$b#Oh... It's gone.$s"
"It's not a good time of year for a diet...$s"
"The forest looks beautiful in the winter, doesn't it?"

"Hi... did you sell {1} {2} to the general store the other day? I think I bought it...#$e#It was pretty high-quality stuff. As soon as I smelled it I was back in Granny's old cottage..."
"Hi... did you sell {1} {2} to the fish shop the other day? I think I bought it...#$e#It was pretty high-quality stuff. Very firm meat."

"Dear @,^I ordered too much fertilizer for the garden!! I bet you can put it to some good use. Take care!
"@,^this recipe of mine won 1st place in a cooking competition! I hope you like it. Thanks for being a friend!
"Farmer @-^I have a request for you. I need fresh cauliflower for a recipe I want to make. Could you bring me one?

"Did you wipe your boots off before coming in? Sorry... I just cleaned the floor.#$e#But you're always welcome in here! Heh.$h"

"*puff* ...hi @! *pant* Whew... that was quite a workout, walking all the way up here.$h\"
"Anyway... I came by to ask if you wanted to have dinner with us tonight!#$b#You don't have to... but if you decide to come, could you please bring a largemouth bass with you?#$b#...that's right. One of those big, slimy fish from the lake. I need one for the casserole I'm making.$h#$b#Okay, well... it'll be at our house at around 7:00 PM tonight... don't forget the largemouth bass! Bye.\"
"Fish casserole always hits the spot.\"

"Ah, I'm so glad you came, @! And you brought the fish! Wonderful.\"
"Sam! Could you come in here and help clean this fish?\"
"Wow, it looks wonderful... and it smells so fresh! Thanks so much for doing this, @.#$b#Kent caught a fish, too, but he eats about a whole fish to himself!$u\"

"Oh hi, @! Come in! Do I smell fresh fish?\"
"Sam! Could you come in here and help with dinner?\"
"Wow, this looks like quality bass, @. Thanks so much for bringing this.$h\"

"What was that sound?\"
"*gasp*$s\"
"This is absolutely terrible! What happened?$u\"
"$p 80#Thanks for telling me the truth, @. It's not such a big deal.|You did WHAT, Sam?! What's gotten into you?!$u\"
"Thanks, honey.$h\"

"Hi, @! I'm just making some popcorn.$h\"
"But, dear... popcorn was always your favorite before you left.$s\"
"*whisper* @... can you say something to him?$s\"
"It's okay, dear.$s#$b#The last thing I want to do is make you upset. I'll do my best to keep your spirits up from now on.\"

"I overheard the price... that's outrageous! You should be ashamed.$3\"
"No way!\"
"Your veggies look great, @. It's Pierre's price that turned us away.\"

"Sam? I'm coming in!\"
"What's wrong, Honey? Were you doing something... bad?#$b#I thought I heard some weird sounds coming from your room...\"
"Oh! *giggle*... That explains why you're all red and sweaty.$h#$b#Okay, well good luck. I'll see you in the morning.\"

"Boycott!\"

"Oh no...\"
"Yum!\"

“It must be so thrilling to travel the world like they do... *sigh*...”

“Vincent hates going to the doctor more than anything, but he'll just have to deal with it.”
“Be brave, Vincent. Think of your father.”
“Doctor Harvey? I'm worried about Vincent's height. Isn't he a little short for his age?”
