"Have you met everyone in town yet? That sounds exhausting." 
"Wow, look at these structures!$h#$b#I can tell they were made by a master builder. I'm really impressed!" 
"That was fun!$h" 
"Hey, look! I can see another island from here." 
"Hey @. You know, I was just thinking about how far the town has come since you first moved here.#$b#You should really be proud of all you've done!$h" 
"This is so relaxing..." 
"Veggie salt? Sounds good, but I don't need it." 
"Hmm... when I think of flowers, I think of Evelyn. Maybe show this to her?" 
"Our little plan worked out well, don't you think? Pam and Penny seem really happy." 
"Our little plan worked out well, don't you think? Pam and Penny seem really happy." 
"Ooh... Two tickets for tonight's show, huh? Sounds good! I'll meet you there.$h" 
"Hey! I heard some weird noises last night, and woke up this morning to find the quarry bridge completely repaired!#$b#It's a miracle of woodworking!" 
"I knew it from the moment you stepped off that bus, @... you were destined to be a town hero!$h" 
"Hey! I heard that Lewis showed you around the Community Center... It'd be great if you could fix that place up. It used to be a really nice building!" 
"Have I told you that I built our house from the ground up?#$e#It's definitely been the highlight of my career so far." 
"Hey, if you need any materials or blueprints, my shop is the place you're looking for!#$e#Plus, your business supports the local economy.$h" 
"Hey there, @.#$e#I was just daydreaming about some new carpentry projects.#$e#Are you doing OK at your place? How's the woodwork in your cottage holding up?" 
"You're always welcome to visit us, even if you aren't shopping, you know.$h#$e#It can get pretty lonely up here in the mountains." 
"You've met my son Sebastian, right? He lives downstairs.#$e#He's a little shy, but I'm sure he'll warm up to you if you're nice to him." 
"I miss my Sebby... he was always a little misunderstood, but I believed in him." 
"I found an ashtray in Sebastian's room, and it smelled really weird. Should I be worried about this?#$e#Sometimes I worry about Sebastian... he doesn't have many friends and doesn't really seem to care about his future very much...#$e#I would talk to him about it but he never opens up to me." 
"Sebastian told me he's trying to quit smoking! I'm really proud of him." 
"Our house is in such a beautiful area, don't you think?#$e#I love the fresh air of the mountains." 
"I hope Demetrius doesn't blow the house up with those science experiments of his.#$e#I'm not even sure what he's working on. I think it has something to do with plants." 
"My husband almost set the house on fire last night with his science experiment. One of his beakers exploded and sent a fireball into the rafters! Thank Yoba I used fire-resistant lacquer when I built the place.$u#$e#Sorry if it smells weird in here, @. It's my husband's bizarre science project..." 
"Hi @! It's good to see you.#$e#You're a regular member of the community now, don't you think?" 
"Great, then this blueprint should be a piece of cake for you!$h" 
"Well, then I have the perfect blueprint to get you started!" 
"Wood is a wonderful substance... it's versatile, cheap, strong, and each piece has it's own unique character!" 
"If you need any buildings on your farm upgraded, just ask me!#$e#You'll need to provide enough lumber and stone for the project. And it costs money, too.#$e#But I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results!$h" 
"We're pretty insulated from the rest of the world here in Stardew Valley.#$e#It has its pros and cons." 
"Maru likes gems. She uses them in her inventions.#$e#So how are you and Maru getting along?" 
"You're always welcome to visit us, even if you aren't in the market for a building upgrade!$h#$e#It can get pretty lonely up here in the mountains." 
"Have you met the wild man that lives behind our house?$s#$e#I guess I don't really mind, as long as he doesn't bother us." 
"Hey, it's a perfect time of year to gather wood.#$e#Maybe you can collect enough to upgrade your house!" 
"My parents were bewildered when I told them I wanted to be a carpenter.#$e#They were pretty old-fashioned." 
"I think the farm life is really healthy for Sebby." 
"Our house is in such a beautiful area, don't you think?#$e#Everything looks still after a fresh snow." 

"Woodworking is an ancient tradition that I'm very proud to be a part of.
"Well, winter's almost here. It's a great time to stockpile wood and stone."
"Spring is a busy time of year... so it's nice to have a day off to catch up with friends."
"It feels great to be outside again after that long, cold winter, doesn't it?"
"Ahh... The air smells so sweet with all these flowers.
"Ow... you stepped on my foot, dear."
"*yawn*... It's past my bed-time.$s#$e#Hey, did you see that candle-boat? I crafted it myself.
"Hiya, @. You're welcome to join our family table if you need company.
"I'm sorry, but carving ice parapets requires my undivided attention!"

"Your new {0} will be finished tomorrow! Are you excited?"
"Your new {0} will be ready in {1} days. Just pretend I'm not here."
"Your new {0} will be ready in {1} days. I'm going to be working on this thing day and night!"
"Thank you! I'll get started tomorrow. I should be finished in around three days."
"That's so generous of you! I'll start working on the upgrade tomorrow. It should take around three days."
"...I found you unconscious in the mines. I almost mistook you for a piece of exotic wood!#$b#Be a little more careful next time, okay?
"Okay, I'll start working on your {1} upgrade the day after tomorrow. I always take festivals off.
"Okay, I'll start working on your {1} upgrade first thing tomorrow morning!
"Okay, I'll start working on your new {0} the day after tomorrow. I always take festivals off.
"Okay, I'll start working on your new {0} first thing tomorrow morning!
"This {0} is pre-fabricated, so there's no construction time! Convenient, isn't it?

"Sorry! Shop's closed for the day... I'm at Caroline's place for aerobics club.
"I'm on the island today, but you can still buy something. It's an honor system!

"This is for me? Wow, I absolutely love it!!/224 426 636/Thanks! This is really nice!/-6 -79 424 709/Um... why?/16 330/What the...? This is terrible!/2/Thank you. This might come in handy.//"

"Hey there!^I had some extra wood lying around... I thought maybe you could use it. Take care!
"Dear @,^here is an old recipe that my grandma passed down to me. Enjoy!
"Dear Farmer @,^^I'd like to apologize for joking about your Grandpa's old cottage when we first met. It's really a nice little house!^^However, you might need some more space someday. That's where I can help. If you bring me some raw materials and pay a fee, I can expand your house.^^^The first expansion I offer includes a kitchen. With a kitchen, you'll be able to cook any recipes you've learned!^^Anyway, I hope you're starting to feel at home in Stardew Valley!^^    Your local carpenter,
"Robin here!^I know there's a lot of stone scattered around your farm.^If you have a surplus, you might consider having me build a well for you.^Wells can be placed all over your farm, and serve as convenient places to refill your watering can.^^Just swing by my shop with 75 stones and 1000g when you're ready for it.
"Dear @,^^Thank you for purchasing a coop upgrade! In addition to doubling the capacity of your coop, I've taken the liberty of installing an incubator. ^To use the incubator, simply place an egg inside. If you have space left in your coop, the egg will hatch in several days!^^As always, thanks for your business.
I lost my favorite Axe! If you find it, please return ASAP. I'm having a tough time without it. There's 250g in it for whoever finds the thing.
"@-^How are you doing? Hope the winter hasn't been too hard on you.^Anyway, I'm writing to ask you for some hardwood. I need about ten pieces, if you've got it.^If not, no worries. Take Care!
"Hey @,^^Just wanted to let you know about a new item I'm carrying... it's called a 'Wood Chipper'.^^You can use it to break hardwood into several pieces of regular wood!^^I know wood can be hard to come by in the winter, so if your supply gets low, consider picking one up.
"Hey @,^^Congratulations on completing my little challenge. I'm impressed!^^As an added bonus, I've included the blueprints for a new type of chest. Enjoy!^^^^^^P.S. -- Now that you have all those resources laying around, why not swing by for some construction work?

Hello! You must be @.#$b#I'm Robin, the local carpenter. Mayor Lewis sent me here to fetch you and show you the way to your new home. He's there right now, tidying things up for your arrival.#$b#The farm's right over here, if you'll follow me.
This is % farm.
What's the matter?#$b#Sure, it's a bit overgrown, but there's some good soil underneath that mess!#$b#With a little dedication you'll have it cleaned up in no time.
...And here we are, your new home.
Rustic? That's one way to put it... $4#$b#'Crusty' might be a little more apt, though.
Hmmph.

Wow...

Eep!
Oh... It's Linus, right?
Are you hungry? I could make you some lunch... How about some leftover cave carrot stew?
Heh... okay.
@? You look like you have something to say...
Wow!
That's really generous! What a great idea! I can build a real cozy house for you, Linus.
You'll finally have running water, heat, a roof over your head... just like the rest of us! Isn't that wonderful, Linus?
Whaa..?
I guess I never thought about it that way...
Aww.. What a sweetheart...

These eggs are so rich and yellow... Marnie, are these from your place?

Demetrius, I didn't tell you to get tomatoes. I said to get fruit.
When a normal person says they want fruit, they NEVER mean tomatoes. It doesn't matter what the scientific classification is.

Hi @. I was just cleaning some dust off my saw.
Have you ever made anything out of wood, @?
I think we've become good enough friends that I can trust you with my carpentry secrets!$h#$b#Here, let me show you the blueprints.
You can use these to get creative on your farm. #$b#It feels good to be able to decorate your house with things you've made yourself!

Voila! My newest creation.$h#$b#It's a deluxe four poster bed, crafted from the finest local hardwood.
It's called 'beauty', bud... you know, that thing that most people find enjoyable?
You know, sometimes it feels like you're being deliberately obtuse, just to irritate me. Is that what you're doing?
Hey @... Come in.
Check this out... It's the bed I was able to make thanks to all the wood you gathered.
So, what do you think?
Whatever.$3#$b#Moving on...
Now that I have a prototype, I can start selling them in the shop.
Hey... these might look good in your place, @! What do you say... can we pencil you in for a half dozen?

Oh, hi @.
Sebby, I know you don't like it when I come in here... but I ran into Abigail at the store and she said she was looking for you.
I did... but she said she'd probably stop by anyway.

Great use of wood!

Mmmmm...
No More Joja!

Hey @! So... what do you think?
I feel pretty good about it...#$b#In fact, it might be my finest work yet!
Notice the round window... very very difficult to bend the frame like that.#$b#Oh, and the intricate carvings on the door. Took me forever. Did you notice that?
Oh... heh. I guess I'm rambling about wood again... huh?
Anyway, I'm going to go talk to them... But first I have to ask...
Okay... you stay here, then.
Hi there, neighbors... that's a nice new house you got there!
Hey, don't thank me! Someone else came up with the idea... and they paid for everything, too.
I can't say... They insisted on remaining anonymous.
Well, I wouldn't go *that* far...
Okay... let's go.
Hi there, neighbors... that's a nice new house you got there!
Hey, don't thank me! This was @'s idea... And he paid for the whole thing, too!^Hey don't thank me! This was @'s idea... And she paid for the whole thing, too!
What, you didn't tell your wife about this, @?
@ came up with this idea and paid for the whole thing!

Hey Lewis... since we're funding education without touching the town's coffers, you'll be lowering our business tax, right?

Um... Lewis? All you did was hold the nails.
Yeah... for example, I plan on requesting some hardwood for a bed I want to make.$h#$b#I won't put you on the spot, but if you want to help me out you can just accept the job from this board.#$b#Who knows, maybe if the bed turns out well I'll start selling them in my shop!
So, can we say that you're... --On Board--?
It's fine, Lewis... there's no pressure to help out.$5#$b#Maybe I can get Sebastian to help. He could use some work away from the computer.

“My favorite thing is seeing the boats. The creaking sound of the wood is strangely comforting.”
