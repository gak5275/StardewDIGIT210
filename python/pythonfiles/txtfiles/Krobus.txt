"...Have you encountered others like me, in the mines? I'm sorry if they were hostile towards you. You see, we've learned to fear humans... there have been too many... unpleasant encounters.#$e#You haven't... slain any of my friends, have you?" 
"A 1000 year war between my people and the dwarves recently ended. There's still a lot of resentment on both sides." 
"Please keep my location a secret. If the dwarves knew of me, they'd surely send an assassin." 
"..." 
"Oh, it's an arctic shard! That's a very rare magical item.#$b#I'd bring that to the Wizard if I were you!" 
"I find things here and I sell them. Care to buy anything?" 
"If you put your ear up to the right pipe, you can hear into any house from down here.#$b#I wouldn't eavesdrop, though!$3" 
"Please don't tell anyone about me.#$b#Humans tend to destroy things they can't understand." 
"Please don't tell anyone about me.#$b#Most humans are frightened by us shadow people... maybe for good reason.$s#$b#But regardless, if the townspeople knew about me, I might not be safe here." 
"I am too sensitive to sunlight to go out on most days.#$b#The conditions in here are perfect.#$e#Care to buy anything?" 
"Please, don't be alarmed. I am different than the others.#$e#I've spent a lot of time observing humans. I know you like to shop. Care to see my wares?" 
"Back again? I suppose it does fit into my theory of human behavior." 
"'Krobus' means 'bridge-crosser' in our language." 
"On Fridays I stay silent as a sign of devotion to Yoba." 
"...Sorry, I'm still a little wary of humans. My shop is still open to you, however." 
"You're not like the other humans, are you?" 
"You've opened my eyes to the world of humans. I appreciate that." 
"..." 

"Do you like rainy days as much as I do, @?" 
"We're different in so many ways... but that's alright." 
"Good morning, @. I went out early and found this for you. [305 308 203 795 397]#$e#I hope it's not too strange." 
"I wonder if the wizard knows about... this? I hope he can keep a secret.$s" 
"As much as I try to be civilized, I have the urge to be mischievous sometimes...$6#$e#They say it's a condition of my people." 
"Ah, It's more humid today with the rain... I feel a lot more comfortable." 
"On nights like this, those who gaze out windows sometimes see shadowy figures. To think... it might've been me.$7" 
"If the other shadow people knew about our living arrangement, they would... 'punish' me.$s#$e#Most of them despise humans, you know." 
"You're sopping wet, and cold! Isn't that dangerous to your species?$s" 
"I already had dinner, but it wasn't something you'd be able to eat... sorry." 
"Ever since I left my people, I've been searching for a new home... now I belong somewhere. That means everything to me." 
"It's said that my people came here long ago, when a great catastrophe allowed spirits from the void to cross into the physical plane." 
"The sound of the rain reminds me of the sewers... it's comforting.#$e#The sewers were my refuge... I felt safe there. But don't worry... I feel the same way about my new home, too." 
"If I could come help you, I would... but I'll do my best to keep the house in order." 
"I tried my best to make human food... [203 204 651 225]#$e#You can eat it later, don't worry about it..." 
"I'm happy here, in the house. I like to spend all my time in a good spot... I don't need to \"get out\" like humans do.#$e#But I understand that you need to! Please don't feel like you have to stay here with me.$3" 
"I'm considering spending my day all balled up and wedged in the corner...#$e#What? You mean you don't do that?$3" 
"On Fridays, I like to stay quiet out of respect for Yoba. I hope you don't mind." 
"I wish I could help you on the farm, but I can't go out in the sun..." 
"I cleaned all the bugs out of the house today... Sorry, I didn't save you any! *smack*$7" 
"You feel solid... sometimes I wish I had bones, too...$s" 
"Sometimes I wonder if humans and shadow people could really ever co-exist... It's a lovely idea, but is it realistic?$s#$e#I hope so..." 
"Sometimes I pause and think of all that I've learned about humans from you...#$b#I wish all my fellow shadow people could know this feeling." 
"I want to be a good housemate for you, but I never know if I'm doing well... *groan* $s#$e#I have a hard time understanding human expression. B... but... you're happy living with me?#$e#Okay!$7" 
"Hi, @. Welcome home. You look like you've been working hard out there!$h" 
"I'll stay out here for just a bit, but we've got to be careful... if anyone approaches I'll need to hide!" 
"It's rare that I can step outside!" 
"What a beautiful day!$h" 
"Wide open spaces make me nervous...$s" 
"Please go about your day, I'll just stay here and guard the house." 
"I'll wait here for a bit, and see if any bugs come my way.#$e#I haven't had breakfast yet!" 
"I'm not sure how, but Yoba has blessed this house with a 'child'..." 
"Don't worry... I already made 1 and 2 a void egg omelet." 
"I worry about the future of the children... But I trust that Yoba has a plan for them." 
"This house has been blessed with two children, now... Does that mean Yoba approves of our unconventional living arrangement?" 
"I feel a sensation in my body... is this... 'platonic love'?$l#$b#... Oh, wait... I'm just shedding my skin.$s" 
"I've learned to overcome my bias against humans... but Dwarves still disgust me.$a" 
"You started nibbling on me during the night, and mumbling about 'black lick or ish'... what did you mean by that?$3" 
"We're making progress, and I feel really hopeful.$h" 
"I was just admiring this lovely house... what a wonderful place.$l" 
"I won't ever grow old, but you will. Sometimes it makes me sad... but that's okay.$s" 
"Do you think your Grandpa would approve of a monster living in his house?" 
"Do you think we could get in trouble for living together?$s" 
"It's so bright in here... I might close my eyes for a few hours.$s" 
"I can't go outside, I can only eat certain food, I need the temperature a certain way... I hope it's not too much of a bother to live with me, @.$s" 
"Welwick says I'm cursed today.$s" 
"I'll tell you a secret... I don't actually sleep, I just lay there with my eyes closed..." 
"You're a strange one, to want to live with a creature like me." 
"I'm going to clean the house all day! This is fun.$7" 
"I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? Moving would probably be too dangerous for me." 
"*sigh*... Maybe I should've stayed with my own kind.$s" 
"...Do you still like me?$s" 
"Are you still happy, living with me?$s" 
"I think you'd be happier living with another human...$s" 
"I've detected a change in your behavior... what does it mean? *groan*$s" 
"You only have one short life to live... are you certain you want to spend it with a hideous creature like me?$s" 
"Maybe a relationship like this is destined to fail...$s" 
"You seem unhappy lately...$s" 
"I miss the sewers.$s"

"What's your plan for the new year, @?" 
"You should go to the flower dance tomorrow! Don't worry about me." 
"I get sunburnt very easily, so I need to be careful this time of year." 
"Mmm... what's that lovely smell? You must've been sweating all night...$h" 
"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.#$e#Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's good protein!$h" 
"I don't feel like doing anything today." 
"Have you figured out what you're going to use for your grange display tomorrow?" 
"If I showed up to the Spirit's Eve festival they'd put me in a cage...$s" 
"Thanks for letting me stay here, @. I'm looking forward to another great year!$h" 
"#$c .5#We're so physically different that it's a challenge to live together, isn't it?#$e#I hope the humidity here isn't bothersome to you. We both have to compromise in order to live together!" 
"It's 'spring' now, isn't it? I can smell the peppery aroma of wild horseradish." 
"You call this time of year 'summer', right? The warmth and humidity is nice, but I wish it wasn't so sunny." 
"It's been feeling a bit cooler lately, with a musty smell. You call this time of year 'fall', correct?" 
"The darkness this time of year is very soothing. If only it were warmer!" 

"If you dwarves hadn't driven us from our ancestral home, we'd never have had to resort to violence!#$b#I'm sorry about your family.\"
"Come and get it, shrimpy.\"
"...And I'm truly sorry about the past, Dwarf. I have no personal gripe with you.\"

"@... I'm afraid we'll have to keep this a secret... Neither my people nor yours would accept us living together."
"You know I'll be a very strange person to live with, right? I won't be able to leave the house..."

"Ah, It's more humid today with the rain... I feel a lot more comfortable."
"The sound of the rain reminds me of the sewers... it's comforting.#$e#The sewers were my refuge... I felt safe there. But don't worry... I feel the same way about my new home, too."
"I wish I could help you on the farm, but I can't go out in the sun..."
"Hi, @. Welcome home. You look like you've been working hard out there!$h"
"On a day like this, I can enjoy the outdoors with you. This is really nice!$h#$b#Just let me know if you see anyone coming, so I can hide.$u"

"This is an amazing gift. For my people it is a great honor to receive something like this./72 16 276 337 305 308/Thank you very much./66 265 336 340/Humans have... interesting tastes./-7 -81 2 330/Oh... Um. I guess I'll accept it.//Thank you.//"

"@, I'm not sure how the human message system works, so I asked Wizard to help me write this letter.^^I hope you are doing okay.^^I wanted to share this with you... it's notes on how my people build a certain item.

"Ah, the sewers are flowing quickly today. It'll get nice and humid in here... Just how I like it."

“A human visitor? This is most unusual...
I'm Krobus, merchant of rare and exotic goods.”

“You were gone so long I started to get worried about you! I started crying when I saw your limp body...”
