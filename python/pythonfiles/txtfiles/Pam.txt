"Hey, kid. The name's Pam.#$e#Don't be a jerk and we'll get along fine." 
"Looks like there's some unique fish swimmin' around. Next time I'll have to bring my pole!" 
"Heh... Willy gave us each a piece of his fish jerky on the ride over. Delicious!" 
"Now this is comfort! I might even take my shoes off!$h#$e#Better not look too closely at my feet, kid." 
"It's a special occasion, kid... I'm ordering something unique. Make it a double!$h" 
"Wow, would you look at that... It's like something out of the future.#$b#Hehe, sorry kid... I can't use that. There's more buttons than I have brain cells!$h" 
"I can't believe you bought me a house! Is there any catch?#$e#Sorry, I'm not used to people being so nice...$s" 
"I can't believe someone bought me a house! I wonder if it's some kind of scam?#$e#Sorry, I'm not used to people being so nice...$s" 
"Date night with ol' Pam, huh? Hah!$h^Ladies night with ol' Pam, huh? Hah!$h#$b#Sure thing, kid... I'll see you there." 
"Hey, did you hear about the ol' bus?#$b#Yep... I'm back on the saddle, kid... hehe. Feels nice.$h" 
"urghh... my head...$k#$e#You know, I'd eat healthier food if I could afford it.#$e#Hey, you probably have a lot of tasty grub growin' on your farm, hm?" 
"Nothin' like a sip o' the good stuff to warm these old bones...$h" 
"Ah... Finally./I need a drink./Gus! Gimme the usual./Hey, I'm back!/Ooh boy, am I thirsty!/I'm parched!" 
"Penny! Did you make dinner?/Penny! You done your chores?/Penny! You home?/Hey! I'm home!" 
"Hey, kid. I'd buy you a drink if I could afford it!" 
"Hey Gus! Gimme another round! *hic*$h" 
"*Sigh*... Hey, kid. You're too young to be moping around in a place like this." 
"*gulp* ... I've been looking forward to this beverage all afternoon. Heh heh." 
"Oi, Gus! Gimme another pint of your strongest!" 
"Hey, you! Don't be snoopin' around the trailer when I'm out. Got it?$u#$e#Sorry, but I gotta be cautious with strangers." 
"I was reading the newspaper this morning but then I got depressed. It's a rotten world, kid.#$e#Keep your head screwed on right and you'll make it through in one piece...#$b#That's what my Pappy always used to say. Heh heh heh.$h" 
"$d bus#You don't know how glad I am that the bus is up and running! I feel alive again.|Times have been tough lately. I got laid off of my job as a bus driver. If I got that job back I could drive you to Calico Desert." 
"Blahh... I had one too many caramel porters at the saloon last night... Go away.$k#$e#My house ain't pretty but at least it's by the river.#$e#Hey. Penny's my baby girl. Be nice to her or leave her alone, got it?" 
"Penny says I spend too much time at the saloon...$s" 
"It's awful lonely at home all by myself..." 
"You know, I've been thinking... I wish I had a hobby. Something to do other than hanging around at that saloon every night.#$e#You got any ideas?#$e#...Ehh. Maybe I'll play checkers against myself." 
"Each day's just the same as the last...$s#$b#If only I'd been born rich...$s" 
"Make sure your boots are clean before you go stompin' around in my house.$u#$e#It's annoying to clean a mess. You should know that by now." 
"I wish a team of elves would come during the night and tidy up my house. Hahahaha.$h#$e#I could sure go for some parsnips.#$e#If my legs weren't so stiff I'd visit the mountains every now and then." 
"Are you friends with Gus? He's a pretty good guy.#$e#He even gives me free beer on my birthday." 
"Hey, watch your mouth! No one tells me what to do!$u" 
"...it isn't? That's terrible!$s#$b#...Oh.$s" 
"Hi, stranger." 
"Oh, it's Mr. @.^Oh it's Miss @.#$e#Do you need my help or something?" 
"I had hopes and dreams like you, once... But look at me now.$s#$e#Life doesn't always turn out like you expect.#$e#Ah well. There's no sense dwellin' on what you don't have." 
"Havin' a local farm is good for our town." 
"Maybe if you do real well on your farm it'll boost the local economy.#$e#Then everyone will have a job and we'll all be happy, right?" 
"Oh, hi there, farmer.#$e#I don't often chit-chat with strangers." 
"I always seem to end up at the saloon at some point.#$e#It's too close to my house. It ain't healthy." 
"...Yeah?#$e#You're a fine lookin' young man. Why're you wastin' your time talkin' to an old girl like me?^You're a pretty gal. What're you wastin' your time talkin' to someone like me for?" 
"Don't mind that ol' dog next to the house.#$b#He might look at you cross, but he'll never get up from that box in a hunderd years.#$b#The old boy's name? It's Dusty." 
"Someone's been complainin' about my yard... sayin' it's a mess. Was it you?$u#$e#Hmmm..." 
"If I knew you better, I'd be more inclined to chat." 
"I used to be young, once. Hard to believe, huh?#$e#Time sure goes fast when you grow up.$s" 
"*Sigh*... I guess I'll be popping a frozen dinner into the microwave tonight.$s" 
"Penny's the only one I've got, so you best treat her kindly." 
"Every day is the same old routine...$s#$e#Do you ever have that problem, farmer?" 
"Would you do me a kindness and clean up my house?#$e#Just kidding.$h" 
"Don't you have work to do?#$e#You should be thankful that you have a job rather than moping around town all the time." 
"I miss my old truck driving job. I used to go all around the valley, meetin' people, listenin' to the radio.#$e#Times sure do change." 
"You got any hogs on that farm?" 
"Do you want somethin' from me, kid? Best look somewhere else." 
"I just hope Penny has a good life ahead of her. If you ever have kids you'll know how I feel.#$e#...It's so dry in winter. My skin feels like old parchment." 
"Hey. You better be treatin' Penny right on that old farm of yours. She's the only one I got!" 
"Hey kid. What're you up to?#$e#I'm just passin' time, same as always." 
"It's awful cold. A visit to the saloon should warm me up, don't you think? Heh heh.#$e#Why don't you swing by the saloon later for a taste o' the Oh-Be-Joyful?" 
"Penny sure does like old books. I think she's a heck of a lot smarter than I ever was.#$e#I'm glad." 
"I oughta take up fishin', seein' as how close the river is." 
"Blah... my front yard's a mess.$s" 

Hiya!$h#$b#Gus... I'm awful thirsty, if you catch my drift.
@, what's going on here?
....$u#$b#*sigh* ...Well, I guess I'd better pay off that tab, then.

It's great Gus. And it tastes even better because it's on the house!

Robin... I... I dunno what to say...$s#$b#This is a dream come true... it's all I've ever wanted.
...They probably stayed anonymous so we wouldn't have to feel obligated to them.
Whoever you are... You are truly a pure angel...
Penny, from now on we'll be like a real family... you hear?#$b#I don't wanna be so bitter all the time anymore...$s#$b#I'm gonna try to turn my life around...
This must have cost a fortune, @...$s#$b#...To be honest, this is kind of embarrassing. How can I ever repay you for this?
...I'm sorry.
I'll do whatever you say...
Then... I'll just have to swallow my pride...
*ahem*... Thank you, @.
...We aren't 'poor' anymore, kid... put that thought out of your mind!
Penny, I'm sorry you had to grow up in squalor... But I'm so happy you've found a good home. We both have, now.#$b#I'm going to try my best to live a good life, now...
Thanks, kid.
...I ain't 'poor' anymore, kid... put that thought out of your mind!

That's right
You're in for a treat, kid.
Thanks, kid

Whaddya think you're doing?!
Stop it! I had everything just the way I like it!
It's none of your damn business where I go!
Selfish? I put a roof over your head and clothes on your back and you call me selfish!? You ungrateful little...
You'd better go. I'm sorry you had to see this, kid.
He's a nice young man...^She's a nice young lady...
But I don't want you tellin' others to clean up my house! It's embarrassing! You understand?

Heheh... I see the delivery came in.
Let's have a little taste.
Ptooey!
I said potato, not fermented baboon kidney!
The juice? Yeah, I tried it, kid. $4#$b#How'd it taste? ...Some things are better left unsaid. Let's just leave it at that.

Hey, kid...
You caught me prayin'...
This here's my new 'Sign Of The Vessel' statue.#$b#...Ordered it from Joja.com with free 2-day shipping. Don't tell Pierre.
...I've been settling in to the new house. It's really a great place. Feels like home already. I really do appreciate this new comfort.
Oh, Sorry...
*sniff*... It's just...$s#$b#...I should be so happy...
...But I haven't been able to cut back on the beer... I haven't changed at all...
For a long time, now... I've felt like there's something missing from my life, @... $s#$b#I always thought it was about money... Just bein' poor... ya know? So I figured gettin' this house would solve everything. But ...it didn't.$s#$b#So that's... That's why I ordered this statue.
That ain't funny! ...I pour my heart out to you and that's how you respond? What in the void is wrong with you?
I don't care what you say... I have faith in Yoba! Plenty of us do! Now get out.
Hah! Well, look at me! I'm gettin' real sappy in my old age, aren't I?  ...hehehe.
Thanks for lendin' an ear, kid

“Hehe... I put something nice into the punch. Shhh... that's just between you and me, kid.”

“	“Now this is the life... Huh, kid? Sweet wine, a babbling brook, warm air... Did I mention wine?”

“	“Heh... free buffet. One of the perks of living here. Enjoy it, kid!”

“	“Don't tell Gus, but I'm a little disappointed there's no buffet tonight.”

“	“Better hurry up, kid... Before ol' Pam here fishes every last lunker out of the tent! Hehe.”

“	“I'll come to any event with free grub! You won't see me in the haunted maze, though.”

“	“I plan on winning the ice fishing competition! Willy is gonna be pretty hard to beat, though... He does this kinda stuff day and night.”

“	“Hmmph... I'm still upset I didn't win the ice fishing competition.”

"Hey... If you're gonna feed me eggs, I'm gonna need some hot sauce, kid!"

"Hey, hey! Now this is really something! Thanks a million, kid./24 90 199 208 303 346 459 873/You did good with this one, kid. Thanks!/-6 -75 -79 18 227 228 231 232 233 234 235 236 238 402 418/This just ain't my thing./-5 16 80 330/Now this is just absolutely despicable.$u#$e#(Is this some kind of mean joke?)/149 151/Thanks, kid.

"Hey. ^I found this in a drawer somewhere. Thought you could use it.
"Hey Kid,^here's the recipe for a little treat my pappy used to make. Cook it slow.
"Hey Kid,^My throat's about as dry as a desert bone. I'm real thirsty for a pale ale. You got one? Regular old beer won't do. I need a pale ale.
Does anybody have one of them battery packs? My TV remote died, and it's a real hassle getting off the couch to change the station.
"Hey kid,^^Thanks for the 'juice'. It definitely had a ...one-of-a-kind... flavor.^^By the way, have you ever tuned in to channel 736? It's a seasonal fishing program that you might find interesting.

"Howdy, kid. Stayin' dry?"
