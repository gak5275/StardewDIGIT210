"Ah, yes. I have predicted your arrival a long time ago, young @.#$e#However, your fate is ultimately in your own hands." 
"Ah... an arctic shard.#$b#A most powerful substance, indeed, and potently infused with the element of ice.#$b#I'll take it, if you don't mind.#$b#...#$b#...Erm...You're still here. Oh. You want something?#$b#...Take this." 
"Hmm... I suppose I could accompany you... yes. Once you've arrived, I shall appear. Farewell." 
"Ah, yes. I have seen many things about your future, young @.#$e#If I were to tell you, there could be grave consequences." 
"If you have nothing important to tell me, leave me be. I have much work to do." 
"I trust you enough to allow you in my basement. Treat what you find there with respect." 
"It takes years of study to understand the language of the elementals.#$e#To actually speak their language requires a lifetime of devoted effort.#$e#Now, if you'll excuse me..." 
"There are many mysteries around us. You must be patient if you wish to discover them." 
"You musn't tell anyone... but I have reason to believe that one of the locals is actually my daughter...#$e#I could be mistaken... It's rare, but it does happen." 
"I believe the townsfolk are afraid of me.#$e#It is unfortunate, but I suppose it is human to be afraid of the unknown." 
"I was married, long ago. After my wife and I split, she began flying around the countryside, cursing everything she saw.#$e#It's not a very mature way to express one's anger." 
"Beware, you are standing above a potent magical field.#$e#I built my hut right here on purpose, you know." 
"Have you made any headway with the forest spirits?" 
"I sometimes observe the local villagers in secret.#$e#I am hoping to find an apprentice. Some day I will leave this mortal plane, but my arcane pursuits must continue." 

"Welwick and I have known each other for a long time... she is a remarkable diviner, and a good friend.#$e#...#$e#That clown... I know him from somewhere.#$e#Was it the school of illusion? Or maybe the Carnival of Secrets? Hmm..."
"The affairs of mundane folk matter little to me, but the elementals like a chance to see you up close.#$e#It was for them that I created this silly maze."
"Hmm... And what about raw lizard egg sprinkled with blackened marrow?"
"You shouldn't be up here."
"The merpeople are curious about your festivities.#$e#They become upset when you litter into the ocean."
"How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden.#$b#Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance.#$e#I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form."
"Ah, the mysterious Winter Star. One of the reasons I chose this valley as the location for my... research."
"Sneaking off to visit my weird tower? You're odd for a mundane."

"What are you doing? I only allow those I trust to enter there.  "

"Ahh, this is imbued with potent arcane energies. It's very useful for my studies. Thank you!/155 422 769 768/Many thanks. This item has some very interesting properties./-12 72 82 84/This?... I suppose I'll cast it into the flames and see what happens./-5 -6 -81 2 16 330 766/Ughh... These are utterly mundane. Please refrain from bothering me with this in the future.//Thank you. This will prove useful, I think.//"

"Greetings, young adept.^I have enclosed in this package an item of arcane significance. Use it wisely.
"My sources tell me you've been poking around inside the old community center.^Why don't you pay me a visit?^My chambers are west of the forest lake, in the stone tower. I may have information concerning your... 'rat problem'.
"@-^I am researching the forgotten art of shadow divination. I require an item known as 'Void Essence'. Bring it to me and you will be rewarded.
"@,^I'm creating an enchanted staff of phenomenal power.^However, I'm missing something: an Iridium Bar.^I'm willing to pay 5x the market value for it. Bring it as soon as you can.
"The specimen you delivered offered great insight into the machinations of the fell beings we call 'monsters'.^^I've formulated a pungent tincture that these beings find intoxicating. Use it with caution...
"Thanks to the ectoplasm you delivered to me, I've made a major breakthrough in the field of arcane engineering.^^Enclosed, you'll find blueprints for a most useful machine...

"Stormy days are the only time I can commune with certain elementals.#$e#I don't expect you to understand."

"Ah... @. I've been waiting for you.\"
"Have I ever told you I used to be married?\"
"Strange, I know... for a man like me. But it's true.\"
"My wife and I were together for many years, until... until I made a mistake that drove her away.\"
"Her anger and envy were so intense that she turned green and began flying around the countryside, cursing everything in her path...\"
"When I found out, I sealed this passage to her home... fearing that an innocent villager might fall prey to her dark magic.\"
"But now, it must be unsealed... for when we separated, she took my magic ink!#$b#I need that magic ink back!$h#$b#I would do this myself, but I... I can't see her again. That's why I need your help.\"
"In order to unseal this passage, you'll need a dark talisman. Talk to Krobus, in the sewer... he should know where to find one.\"
"I'm counting on you... if you can retrieve my magic ink I promise I'll make it worth your while... Now go!\"

"Silence! Both of you!\"
"The Elemental Wars have long been finished. You have no reason to be fighting any longer.#$b#The two of you must make peace for the sake of the humans that live around you. Surely you can see that.\"
"Very good. I shall cast a 'Seal of Promise' to finalize this agreement.\"

"Ah... Come in.\"
"I am Rasmodius... Seeker of the arcane truths.#$b#Mediary between physical and ethereal.#$b#Master of the seven elementals.#$b#Keeper of the sacred cha-... you get the point.\"
"And you... @. The one whose arrival I have long foreseen.\"
"Here, I'd like to show you something.\"
"Behold!\"
"You've seen one before, haven't you?\"
"They call themselves the 'Junimos'...#$b#Mysterious spirits, these ones... For some reason, they refuse to speak with me.\"
"I'm not sure why they've moved into the community center, but you have no reason to fear them.\"
"Hmmm? You found a golden scroll written in an unknown language?#$b#Most interesting...\"
"Stay here. I'm going to see for myself. I'll return shortly.\"
"I found the note...\"
"The language is obscure, but I was able to decipher it:\"
"Hmm... 'One with the forest'... What do they mean?\"
"...*sniff*...*sniff*...\"
"Ah-hah!$h\"
"Come here!$h\"
"My cauldron is bubbling with ingredients from the forest.$h#$b#Baby fern, moss grub, caramel-top toadstool... Can you smell it?$h\"
"Here. Drink up. Let the essence of the forest permeate your body.$h\"

"You've found my ink! Excellent.\"
"Er...\"
"Did you... happen to see my ex-wife?#$b#No? Well, what about her house...?#$b#Do you think she lives alone? Or...$h\"
"...Actually, don't tell me... I don't want to know.\"
"Anyway... you must be wondering about your reward. Here...\"
"It's a book of summoning.#$b#The arcane potential is immense... but I'll make it simple for you.#$b#By using this book, you can summon magic buildings directly to your farm.#$b#I think you'll find it useful.\"
"Oh, I almost forgot to say... ahem... Thank you.\"
