"Oh... you're that new farmer boy, aren't you?^Oh... You're that new farmer girl, or whatever. Aren't you?#$e#Huh? Oh... I'm Haley.#$e#Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be cute.^Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be pretty... Actually, nevermind.$h" 
"I saw a dolphin on the way in!" 
"There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good." 
"It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?" 
"Wow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon!$h#$b#I bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo.#$e#I have to remember to bring my camera next time." 
"Getting the perfect tan is an artform...#$e#It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right.$h" 
"Laying out on a tropical beach.#$b#*sigh* I think I've finally found my place in the universe.#$e#But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either!$h" 
"Emily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City.#$e#City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it?$h" 
"I painted my toenails blue to match the sea. What do you think? *wiggle* *wiggle*$h" 
"Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me!$h" 
"This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!" 
"Ew... No." 
"I'll be fine on my own...$7#$e#Thanks for the memories.$7#$e#Why are you still clinging to me? Go live your own life.$7" 
"Agh!$8#$b#Oh... hmph. Beat me to it, huh? Alright..." 
"I've got nothing to say to you!$a" 
"Alright, alright... I'm done giving you the cold shoulder. Just promise me you'll never, ever lie to me again.$s" 
"This town is so small. It sucks.$u#$e#I have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes.$s#$e#That's why I usually just order online.#$e#What?" 
"Nice shoes.^Nice makeup.#$b#Are those made out of plastic?^Or wait... Are you even wearing any?#$e#I'm bored." 
"The only thing I like about this town is the beach.$u" 
"I've decided I am going to organize my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!#$e#*sigh* I could really go for a cupcake right now.#$e#Do you need something?" 
"Don't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do?#$e#I couldn't stand getting all dirty like that.#$e#You probably get a nice tan, though." 
"I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here." 
"My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related.$u" 
"There are only two things I like about this town.#$b#One of them is the beach.#$e#The other one is a secret! *giggle*$h" 
"I wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning?#$e#This isn't the best time of year for shells, though." 
"I'm glad that the flowers are starting to bloom.#$e#Those pink ones smell so good.$h" 
"I need to find some kind of hobby other than shopping.#$e#I've decided I want to expand my horizons.#$e#Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?" 
"I used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it.#$e#If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community." 
"I cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay!#$e#But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen..." 
"I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes." 
"Yesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing.$k$s#$e#You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever." 
"@, can we go on a camping trip someday?#$e#The most exotic place I've been is Zuzu city." 
"*sigh*...$u" 
"NO!! I'm not going to do it!$a#$b#You guys are both stupid!$a" 
"She should take the 'high road'? What's that supposed to mean?$u#$b#You think I'm being a baby, huh?$a" 
"Great, then you shouldn't have any problem opening this jar for me!$h" 
"Oh... you aren't? Hmmm...$s#$b#Well could you try opening this jar for me anyways?" 
"Aw, thanks!$h" 
"Oh! I thought you knew.#$b#This room's for developing photos." 
"Is that so...?$s" 
"Aw, thanks!$h" 
"Oh! I thought you knew.#$b#This room's for developing photos." 
"Is that so...?$s" 
"No, you won't! This bracelet was passed down to me by my great-grandmother!$a" 
"*sigh*$s#$b#...Maybe it'll wash up on another shore. I can't bear to think of it at the bottom of the ocean.$s" 
"Him? No!#$b#...Well, I guess I used to like Alex. But not anymore! He's immature." 
"What? That sounds fun, but I wouldn't want to leave Stardew Valley right now..." 
"Huh? What's an android?" 
"I'm going to get such a nice tan this summer." 
"Ew, you're all dirty." 
"Um... Yes?#$e#I didn't hear you, I'm thinking about something else." 
"Do you have baby bunnies on your farm? Bunnies are SO cute! <" 
"If you stay in the sun a lot it'll make your hair lighter.#$e#It's a good thing to know!" 
"I wonder what Alex is doing today...#$e#Huh? I didn't notice you standing there." 
"Farming sounds so boring... What do you even do all day?#
"#$p 43#Hey, you better not be snooping around in my room anymore!$a|But I guess it could get you in pretty good shape." 
"Hmm... sounds like a lot of work." 
"What? You'd better not be doing that!$a" 
"Emily usually cooks dinner... But she makes weird stuff like quinoa." 
"Do you wear those clothes every day?" 
"$p 47#Hey I found this new tool to open jars with. So you won't need to help me anymore.$h|There's not a cloud in the sky today.$h" 
"It's so hot today!#$e#I wish I had some ice cream.$s" 
"I spent 3 hours practicing my signature today.#$e#I guess that's pretty silly, huh?" 
"If you stay in the sun a lot it will make your hair lighter... But you don't want to get sunburnt, either.#$e#I just want a healthy amount of sunlight. Everything in moderation, right?" 
"I should start reading some books instead of magazines.#$e#It's good to learn things, isn't it?#$e#I only ever look at the pictures." 
"I talked to my sister for a while last night. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.#$e#You know, Emily's not actually that weird. I guess we have more in common than I used to think.#$e#Don't tell her I said so." 
"It seems like a good day to go swimming." 
"I guess living in the country isn't so bad.#$e#If I lived in the city I might start to miss all the trees.#$e#@, I think I've been hanging out with you too much.$h" 
"Oh, hi @!#$e#Do you like kids?$l" 
"It's fall already?$s" 
"It's gross when all these fallen leaves get slimy." 
"Hmm... Something smells weird...#$e#You've been working on the farm, huh?" 
"Oh, hi. Did you want something?" 
"I feel the urge to go shopping. *sigh*" 
"Is that a grass stain on your knee?#$e#Sorry, I'm allergic to grass." 
"It's too cold to go to the beach anymore. *sigh*...what do you think I should do today?
"I'll probably take a nap later." 
"Hmm... That's a pretty good idea, actually." 
"Get away from me, you stupid jerk.$a" 
"I've never been to the forest. It's muddy and I could get a blister on my foot." 
"Something smells earthy...#$b#Oh, right. You work on a farm." 
"You look like you've been doing a lot of hard work.#$b#Why don't you take the rest of the day off?" 
"If you're ever bored, come say hi." 
"Shopping just doesn't sound as fun as it used to.#$e#What's happening to me?#$e#Hmm..." 
"$p 48#Did I ever tell you I found another one of my great-grandma's bracelets in the attic?|See this bracelet? It belonged to my great-grandmother.#$e#She was a really interesting lady." 
"I've never been to the forest, you know.#$e#It might be interesting to explore it some day." 
"I'm starting to like the smell of dirt. Isn't that weird?#$e#I think it's because you're around all the time.$h" 
"@, I'm happy to see you today.$h" 
"I want to move somewhere warmer." 
"Hi. Do you need something from me?#$e#..." 
"Hmm. What brand is your shirt?#$e#Oh. Um, nevermind." 
"I wish someone would bring me a peppermint coffee.$s#$e#Don't even bother, I know you won't be able to make one." 
"I'm going to start writing a list of all the clothes I need for next spring." 
"Do you have a pony on your farm?$h#$e#Oh. That's disappointing...$s" 
"The only good thing about winter is that I get to sleep more.#$e#I like at least 10 hours of sleep every night." 
"Will you say hi to Alex for me?#$e#Thanks." 
"Your name is @, right?#$e#I keep forgetting." 
"Hi @.#$e#Is anything exciting happening on your farm?" 
"I think I'm starting to realize that clothes aren't the most important thing. Right?#$e#I still like clothes, though. I mean, what's wrong with expressing yourself a little?" 
"Maybe I'll donate some of my skirts to a charity this spring.#$e#I mean, I do have over 1,000 skirts.$h#$e#...what?" 
"Um, if you see Alex could you tell him I'm busy today?#$e#Thanks." 
"I wish it were warmer here in Stardew Valley.#$e#I could move somewhere else, but..." 
"Do you think you'll ever have a pony on your farm?" 
"I'm glad you have less work to do in the winter.#$e#It must be nice to have a break, huh?" 
"@, you look rugged today. I like it.^@, you look pretty today.#$e#...$h" 

"I've changed a lot over the years, but I still prefer sunny weather." 
"Sometimes I daydream about our retirement... relaxing on the sunny beaches of the Fern Islands!#$e#Do you ever think about the future, @?" 
"Good morning! I got up early and baked something sweet for you! [223 234 211 651 731]#$e#I know you're strong, but you still need to eat well to stay at your best!$h" 
"I can't go outside today... my hair will go limp. Forgive me, dear.$s#$e#I want to look my best for you." 
"Are you going out in this weather? Just make sure to wipe your boots on the way back in, honey.#$e#I'll just stay here and do some housework." 
"Say 'goat cheese'!" 
"Oh no... If this weather keeps up I'll get so pale.$s" 
"Oh, I'm glad you're back. It's so cold in here by myself... Are you almost ready to shut off the lights?" 
"I hope it's nice and sunny tomorrow morning. Too much rain can make me moody.$s" 
"I hope Emily isn't too lonely all by herself. I should visit her again soon.$7" 
"Rain is horrible for a photographer. The lighting is awful, and you can't go outside without ruining your equipment!$s" 
"I made a hot meal for you, honey. Lots of spice, just how you like it. Enjoy! [727 231 207 199]$h" 
"I never thought I'd say this, but the country lifestyle really suits me.$h" 
"Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely.$l" 
"Good morning! Did you sleep well?$h#$e#I think I might break out the old camera today... the lighting is just perfect." 
"Good morning, dear! Smells good, doesn't it? I made you breakfast! [194 195 210 211 216]#$e#I know you're busy with your work. I'm here to support you in any way I can!" 
"Did you sleep okay? You were snoring a little.$h#$e#I've got some chores to do in here. Have a good day." 
"I'm glad I've learned to enjoy cleaning! The house gets dirty very easily.$10#$e#It's satisfying to get everything squeaky clean.#$e#Can I have a kiss before you leave?$11" 
"Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh?#$e#I'll be thinking of you. <$h" 
"I felt like I had no direction in life before I met you. Now I have exactly what I want.$l" 
"You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress.$l" 
"I always feel best when I'm outside, breathing fresh air.#$b#Don't get me wrong, your grandpa's old cottage is very nice! But nothing beats this beautiful landscape." 
"We've got to make sure the farm is cute! That might be important... right, honey?" 
"Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry!#$e#I'll be thinking of you.$h" 
"I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right?#$e#*phew*... it's hot out here." 
"Don't overwork yourself, dear.#$e#Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.$h" 
"Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?" 
"I'm going to socialize in town for a bit today." 
"It was nice seeing everyone in town. Did you have a good day, dear?" 
"Isn't it strange? I'm not used to being a mother." 
"Isn't 2 a very good-looking baby?" 
"A big house, two kids, and a beautiful plot of land. I'm not sure what else I could ask for." 
"So, what are we planting this season?" 
"Now that winter's over, we've got lots of sunny weather to look forward to. I'm excited." 
"Sorry if I don't look my best... the air is just so humid that my hair doesn't hold up too well." 
"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies and ants... yuck.$s" 
"I already miss summer..." 
"Fall is kind of sad for me... everything is dying.$5" 
"My skin feels so dry in this weather." 
"For some reason, the snowy weather gives me cravings for pink cake..." 
"Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now." 
"I love watching the fireflies on a hot summer's night. It's the closest I'll ever come to visiting the stars." 
"Even though I prefer summer, fall might be the best season to take pictures. Those long, low shadows..." 
"I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles. Remember that?$h#$e#We've come a long way since then.$l" 

"Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year."
"Have you been to the fortune teller? She set up her stand in the graveyard.#$e#I already saw her... she told me something... interesting. *giggle*$h"
"I get scared easily... I think I'm just going to stay right here.$s"
"Eek! I'm too scared.$s"
"I was going to eat some eggs, but then I remembered I'm on a spring diet."
"This festival is alright... but what I'm really looking foward to is the Flower Dance."
"Oh! I still need to get my photo taken at the bunny stand. Does my hair look okay?"
"I'm practicing my dance moves... It needs to be perfect.#$e#I've been flower queen for the past 5 years and I'm not ready to step off the throne just yet!"
"Phew... I'm afraid to move, or else I might start to sweat."
"I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty."
"I should've brought my camera! I always forget.$s"
"Brr... my hands are freezing from making this snowman.$l"
"I guess Winter isn't all bad... playing in the snow can be fun!"
"Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight?$l"
"I hope there's a new camera for me under the spirit tree!"

"I'm so happy!$h#$e#It's just like I always dreamed.
"It's okay. I know we can't have a honeymoon, since your farm needs to be taken care of.#$e#I'm a farmer now, too!"

"Emily tried to serve me {1} {2} for dinner last night... I threw it away when she wasn't looking.#$e#I don't like health food...

"*giggle*... "Oh, it's just that...#$b#As a little girl, I always dreamed that one day, I would climb to the summit with my true love, and share a kiss.

"Hmmph. If this weather keeps up I'll get too pale.
"Hi, honey. I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely.
"I always feel happy on a sunny day.
"You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress.
"Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?
"Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now."
"You must know by now that summer is my favorite season.
"I'm craving cake.#$e#But not just any cake... it has to be pink."
"I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles.$h#$e#We've come a long way since then.
Go ahead and start your day, honey. I'm just putting on my make-up.#$e#Have any plans for the day?"

"Oh my god, this is my favorite thing!!/221 421 610 88/*gasp*...for me? Thank you!/18 60 62 64 70 88 222 223 232 233 234 402 418/Ugh...that's such a stupid gift./-5 -6 -75 -79 -81 80 -27/Gross!/-4 2 16 330 74/Thank you. I love presents.

"Oh, you have to leave already?$s#$b#Well... alright. Bye.
"Wow... I didn't think he/she was that dense.
"I thought you had something important to do...

"@,^I thought it would be fun to write you a note.^ I had so much fun with the cows yesterday... I'm starting to understand why you chose the farmer's life! Hope to see you soon.

"I spent all morning doing my hair... now the rain could mess it up.$s#$e#*sigh* ... Life is hard sometimes."

“It's nothing serious... I'm just here for my annual check-up.”
“	“Well... my nose has been a little runny, Doctor. But otherwise I'm doing fine!”

“Brrr.... I'm not dressed for this...”

“Ew... No.”

“The weather's too horrible to get out of bed.”
