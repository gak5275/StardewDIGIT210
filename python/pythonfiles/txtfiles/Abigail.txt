"Oh, hi."
"Oh, that's right... I heard someone new was moving onto that old farm. It's kind of a shame, really. I always enjoyed exploring those overgrown fields by myself." 
"I hope a mermaid visits the beach." 
"I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back." 
"Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back." 
"The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!" 
"Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island?Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways." 
"My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while.I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy." 
"Hey @, want to build a sand castle with me?Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler!" 
"Hey @, you think you could build a raft?I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit." 
"An island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure.Quick, get me a shovel!Relax, I'm just kidding." 
"Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great!" 
"Bummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach...And I brought my sword and everything..." 
"That's flattering... but I'm gonna have to say no. Sorry." 
"What are you doing here? Just leave me alone!" 
"Don't talk to me!" 
"*sigh*... I can't stay mad at you anymore, @. Let's just move on with our lives." 
"Oh... I... I understand. You see me as just a friend...I guess we weren't really a good match..." 
"Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?" 
"Oh, hi!Do you ever hang out at the cemetery? It's a peaceful place to spend some time alone." 
"Ugh... I'm not in a good mood right now.I said I'm not in a good mood... what do you want?" 
"...*sigh*...I know my parents mean well, but sometimes they just cannot understand my point of view. Weren't they ever young?" 
"Hey. Sorry in advance if I say anything rude. I didn't get much sleep last night.What do you want?" 
"Oh no, I think my Dad's going to cook dinner tonight...I don't feel like doing anything today..." 
"Wow, I just realized it's Friday. Sometimes I totally lose track of time." 
"We're all going to hang out in the saloon this evening. It's kind of like a friday tradition, I guess." 
"The fresh mountain air is nice on a day like this.I wonder if the frogs will make an appearance soon." 
"Oh man... I've been pushing off my homework all weekend. Looks like I'll be pulling another all-nighter..." 
"I wonder what would happen if I spent all night in the graveyard? @, What do you think happens to us after we die?  
	"I guess you think nothing would happen, right?|Maybe a wicked ghost would appear!" 
	"Hmm, interesting..." 
	"Well that's an interesting theory!" 
	"You know, that wouldn't be so bad." 
"Oh, hi @. Taking a break from your work?Me too. Oh! Nothing physical... just some online classes I'm taking." 
"Hi, I'm glad to see you.I want to take my mind off things for a while... how is your day going?" 
"You came all this way to visit me? That's nice.So have you been exploring the mountain caves at all?Interesting. I'd like to go there myself one of these days." 
"...Oh, @! Hi.Want to hang out for a while? Here! Let me read your palm. *giggle* " 
"Hi. Do you feel like everything seems unreal lately? Not in a bad way, though." 
"The birds were happily chirping today. They're too simple to understand the future.It's better to be like them, isn't it?" 
"Great! I'm sure you'll be able to beat this level with ease." 
"Oh? *sigh*... I guess I'll never get past this level, then..." 

"See? You understand why I'm out here, then.I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!" 
"Sure. I don't want to kill anything, either. I just want to do a little exploring without risking my neck!I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!" 
"Oh, it's because I'm a girl... isn't it? Ugh... Why? I'm just as strong as you! I'm not some fragile princess.. I can take care of myself! I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!" 
"Really? That's surprising.I've lived in the valley my whole life, but I've never really done anything memorable. I want to go on an adventure!" 
"I see..." 
"Yea... I guess you would be one to appreciate this somber ambience." 
"...That's true." 
"Yeah... I guess my own life is okay..." 
"...!" 
"I would feel better if I could believe that...But I don't." 
"@..." 
"@... I'm alright." 
"...okay." 
"I guess when you have something to lose, it's normal to be afraid..." 
"...Um, okay. Sorry." 

"Summer's here. It's not really my favorite season.The air is so muggy I feel like I'm floating in soup." 
"My pet guinea pig, David, just hates this hot weather. He's fussy." 
"The air is so thick with honey and nectar all summer. I almost feel dizzy." 
"Have you decorated your house at all? That's what I'd be doing if I had a house." 
"I went to the beach last night, after dark... Sometimes you can see strange lights bobbing over the sea.Or maybe that was just a dream I had... It doesn't feel real anymore." 
"If I knew how to use a sword I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now. It's probably nice and cool in there." 
"Ew, I hope I don't get a tan this summer." 
"I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything." 
"I'm looking forward to fall... the cool mountain breeze, the swirling red petals, the smell of mushrooms... *sigh*" 

"Do you ever get an urge to go exploring, @? Okay... pretend you just won a free vacation. Where would you go? 
"I do... but you probably wouldn't like the places I'm thinking about...|Maybe we'll be neighbors someday. I think we both have similar, weird tastes." 
	"Huh. I think that would get old fast." 
	"Yea! That sounds wonderful." 
"I would love to live in an old farmhouse like you.The creak of a floorboard, the slow plumes of dust whispering through the rafters... There's something special about an old building, isn't there?" 
"You're an interesting guy, @. I'm glad you moved here.^You're an interesting lady, @. I'm glad you moved here." 
"I'm actually enjoying myself this summer.It's funny how quickly one's outlook can change." 
"I used to think Pelican Town was kinda drab, but lately I'm starting to love some things about it." 
"Wow, you look nice today.I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh..." 
"Do you ever get lonely on your farm?" 
"Ah... Fall's here!I was getting so tired of summer." 
"I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today." 
"I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.|Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop!" 
"I can't wait to see some pumpkins this year.The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun." 
"Last night I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic %. Does that mean anything?" 
"I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.|Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?" 

"Hmm... what should I do tonight? I was thinking about dyeing my hair again... what do you think? 
"I was going to dye my hair but then I decided against it.|Yes? What is it?" 
	"I guess that's a pretty safe choice, huh?I'll think about it." 
	"Of course that's what you'd say." 
	"You're always good for a laugh." 
"Are you growing pumpkins on your farm this year?Save one for me!" 
"I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best.I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone." 
"Hi.Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?" 
"You know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day...But how would that ever happen? *chuckle*" 
"I had an interesting dream last night, with you in it.It was a good dream." 
"I wish the season lasted a little longer. When the wind really picks up, I almost feel like a kid again." 
"I usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore. @, what are your plans for the future?" 
"Well, fall is over...But I like winter, too!" 
"It's just too cold to go outside much.But I do enjoy building a snowgoon." 
"Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?" 
"Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?" 
"I'm definitely going to enter the egg hunt tomorrow. Are you?" 
"Well, tomorrow is the flower dance. Dancing is alright, but they make me wear this stupid white dress..." 
"I'm looking forward to making a snow man tomorrow." 
"Will I see you tomorrow at the Spirit's Eve festival? Look for me in the haunted maze." 
"Everyone's excited for the Luau tomorrow. Maybe a little nervous, too, considering the Governor will be here." 
"You can't miss tomorrow's festival. It's one of the most beautiful wonders of the valley." 
"I'm going to eat so much cranberry sauce tomorrow." 
"Another year is almost over.It goes by so fast, doesn't it?" 
"One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different." 
"It's the weekend! That means I can play twice as many video games. Bye." 
"Oh, hello. I made these two drawings. What do you think?  
"Remember those drawings I showed you a while ago? I accidentally threw them away.|Remember that drawing I showed you with the orc? I entered it into an online contest and won 50g!" 
	"Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense." 
	"I'm glad. It's embarrassing to share your art with others. But I think you and I are on the same page." 
	"Rude! Why would you hurt my feelings like that? You're so insensitive!" 
"Hi. If you're ever bored, you can always hang out in my room.As long as I'm not changing, of course!" 
"It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share." 
"I've been daydreaming a lot lately...Oh! You want to know what it's about? Well......It's a secret." 
"Another year is almost over...But this was a really good year, don't you think?" 
"It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.And that means you can hang out with me more often!" 
"@, there's something I want to tell you...It's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... *gulp*That's all... *sigh*" 

"The dark... the rain... it gets me excited.$l" 
"Hey, remember when we played that duet by the lake? This weather reminds me of that day.#$e#You really surprised me with that mini-harp... I never expected that. I guess that's why I like you so much.$l" 
"Hey! I woke up early and did some exploring on my own. I found this and it reminded me of you. [768 767 769 66 82]#$e#Think you can find something better than that? I'm not so sure!$h" 
"It might be a good day to visit the caves, huh? Just be careful out there.#$e#If you go, bring a Life Elixir or two." 
"Maybe I'll boot up Journey Of The Prairie King today... one of these days I swear I'll beat it on my own.$h" 
"The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?" 
"I was just gazing out into the rainswept woods... I swear I saw something darker than black shifting around the trees.$6" 
"It's a good night to see a ghost..." 
"Can you feel it? There's a stillness in the rain..." 
"On nights like this, I like to turn the light down low and just listen...$8" 
"I felt like making some soup for dinner. I hope it's not too disgusting. [199 218 219 727 730]$h" 
"Hey! You look like you've been hard at work. Can I help you relax?^Have you been working hard? You look cute when you're a little exhausted.$h" 
"The sound of rain should put us right to sleep tonight." 
"I always loved this place, long before you moved in. Now I can explore the farm whenever I want!$h" 
"Hey, @. Heading out into the wild? I got you something...[286 287 205 732]#$e#Use that if you get into a tough spot. It should help keep you safe." 
"Heading to the mines? Hey... if you find something tasty, remember to bring me a piece!$h" 
"Hey! I'm just debating what I should do today. I'm not used to having this much freedom!" 
"You don't mind if I do some re-decorating now and then, do you? I'm still excited to have a place of my own to work on." 
"There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it." 
"I had a good day, today. There's always something interesting goin on around here, if you look close enough." 
"Hey! Tell me about your day. Did anything exciting happen?$h" 
"I used to be a night owl, but I'm starting to enjoy the rhythm of life on the farm. It feels natural." 
"*yawn*... I'm ready to call it a night pretty soon.$h" 
"The sounds of the night are louder out here. I'll never stop enjoying that." 
"Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us...$l" 
"The soft breeze is blowing mountain air throughout the valley today. It smells like fresh pine and sage." 
"Hmm... I think we've got plenty of space for outdoor slime ranching!" 
"Make sure to keep things tidy around your Grandpa's shrine. There's something special about it, I can feel it." 
"It's pretty cool that we have a cave on our property. It's something I always dreamed about.$h" 
"I always forget to put some snacks in my pocket. *rumble*$h" 
"I'm just going to hang out here, okay?#$e#There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. *chuckle*$h" 
"I'm going in to town today, just so you know. I need to stretch these legs a bit." 
"Hey! Did you have a good day? Mine went well. It was refreshing to take a walk.$h" 
"I can't believe I'm a \"mom\"... life is weird.$h" 
"I already gave 1 and 2 their chocolate cereal. They were screaming!" 
"I had a dream that 2 will grow up to be a famous monster hunter. I've already been thinking about a little armor set." 
"A cool old house, a couple kids, and an amazing farm. I never thought I'd come this far... but, hey! Our lives are just getting started.$h" 
"Did you hear that? Sometimes I'm convinced this house is haunted.$u" 
"Welwick's horoscope predicted great things for me today. I feel really motivated!" 
"I can't even remember the last time I dyed my hair... I swear, it never fades from this color..." 
"I'm glad I owned a heavy pair of boots before moving in. It's hard to imagine tip-toeing around the mud in sneakers.$h" 
"I was just admiring the mermaid's pendant you gave me... I'll proudly wear this to my grave.$l" 
"Hey. I know you're smart, but I still worry about you sometimes. The world is full of monsters.$6#$e#Just promise me you'll be careful. I don't want to lose you." 
"@? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for us. I'm really proud of you.$l" 
"I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and shriveled. It's going to happen some day!" 
"Do you think your Grandpa would be proud of us?" 
"I wonder how the old shop is doing? I should visit my parents again soon." 
"If you moved on to the spirit world, I'd set up a little shrine for you next to Grandpa's." 
"No matter how much we clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.#$e#I guess farms are kind of dirty." 
"I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? I might get bored." 
"I used to be special to you, your best friend... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.$s" 
"You've been so cold to me lately... What's wrong with you? You're acting like a bog spirit...$s" 
"I wonder if I could've done better... I was very good friends with Sebastian before we met. He was probably the one...$s" 
"So, do you have any big plans for the new year?" 
"Hey, the egg festival is tomorrow. I'm sorry, but I won't go easy on you because we're married!$h#$e#I plan on winning that egg hunt. Go ahead and try to beat me." 
"Do you have any new year's resolutions? I'm trying to lose a few pounds around the middle.$h" 
"I get sunburnt very easily, so I need to be careful this time of year.#$e#I hope you like me pale!$h" 
"Make sure you don't get a heat stroke, my love.#$e#Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself." 
"Sorry about the smell... I was sweating all night in the heat." 
"It's summer... that means the house is full of flies.#$e#Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's fun!$h" 
"Ah... fall. This might be my favorite time of year. The colors really complement my hair, don't you think?" 
"The scent is unmistakable... mushroom, rotting leaves, pumpkin. It's fall, alright. Isn't it lovely?" 
"Can we grow giant pumpkins this season? Please, honey?$h" 
"Honey... you're worth more to me than a chest full of quartz.#$e#Now, a chest full of amethyst? Hmm... I'd have to think about that one.$h" 
"I actually like the cold weather. It just gives me an excuse to get cozy!$h" 
"It's fun to explore the valley in winter! Everything is so different under a blanket of snow. And so quiet..." 
"I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive." 
"Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake." 
"Do I smell pumpkin on you? Maybe I'm just dreaming...$h" 
"Remember when we played 'Prairie King' together in my room, so long ago? Those were good times.$h" 
"#$c .5#I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning.#$e#I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell." 

"I beat all these games last year!$h"
"I already beat all the games... now what?"
"You'll have to tell me what's beyond, I can't go on... spiders...$s"
"I can't go on... spiders...$s"
"Go away, we're adversaries until the egg hunt is over!$h"
"Searching for eggs is like going on a treasure hunt.$h"
"$y 'Do you think I'm too old to do the egg hunt?
	Hmmph... you sound like my Mom!$a
	Yeah, I guess so. If I'm still having fun, why stop?'"
"I really hate dancing in front of everyone... It's so embarrassing.#$e#Mom makes me do it.$u"
"Don't let me stop you from having fun today. I just feel like watching the sea by myself."
"It's tiring to socialize with everyone... I'd rather watch the sea."
"Such a rare and exciting thing... "
"Hey, honey... look, it's you!$h"
"What do you think of my snow-goon?"
"I wonder if I could lick one of those canes..."
"Nothing like a piping hot feast on a cold winter's day, huh?$h"

"Hehe. Me? Married? I never thought this would happen.$h#$e#We're going to have a lot of fun together.$h"
"I'm engaged to a farmer. Wow!$h#$e#Our lives are going to be a lot different from now on.$l"

"Hey, don't even think about it! That's private!$a"
"Hey. We had one of those {2}s you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out.$h#$b#Unfortunately it tasted like {3}.$s"
"Hey. We had one of those {2}s you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out.$h#$b#It was still pretty good, though."
"Standing here, looking out on the horizon... I get a feeling of endless possibility.#$b#I'm just happy I get to explore this world, with you by my side...$l"
"The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?"
"There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it."
"I'm ready to hop into bed whenever you are. The sound of rain will put us right to sleep."
"Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us...$l"
