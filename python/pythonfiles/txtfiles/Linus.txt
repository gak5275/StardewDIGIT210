"A stranger?... Hello.#$e#Don't mind me. I just live out here alone." 
"What do you have there? Looks like it would make good bait.$h" 
"My old friend, the glimmering boulder, has moved on. It may not seem like an important event, but to me it's a big change.#$b#I'm happy for the old rock to see more of the world, though.$h" 
"Oh... me? I usually wouldn't, but... okay. It's nice of you to think about me.#$b#I'll head over there in a little while." 
"The crisp air of the wilderness is all I care to know.#$e#I live out here by choice." 
"...Have you come to ridicule me?#$e#I'm just minding my own business." 
"I don't know you well enough to trust you. Sorry." 
"...Hmm? Do you want something from me?" 
"Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s" 
"I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends." 
"It would be nice if the townspeople could accept me for who I am.$s#$b#I like living out here in the open air. That's what they don't understand." 
"You can learn to survive in the wild. I have.#$e#I think we all have a hidden urge to return to nature. It's just a little scary to make the leap." 
"I spend a lot of time thinking.#$e#If you can fully understand the reasons behind your thoughts, you'll have reached a new level of being." 
"I have to be wary of strangers. Most people don't like a 'wild man'." 
"The people here seem nice, but they avoid me.#$e#People are afraid of the unknown.$u" 
"You can learn a lot from trees.#$b#Spend time with them and they might tell you their secrets.#$e#Go in peace, young one." 
"I have everything I need to survive, and more. Nature plays a wonderful tune if you can only learn to listen.#$e#I also spend a lot of time reading. One of the reasons I stopped in the valley was for the great library." 
"Someone was throwing rocks at my tent last night... I just had to wait it out.$s$k#$e#I don't like to stay in one place for too long. There's just too much to experience in the world." 
"During all these years I've discovered a few secrets about life.#$e#You'll have to find out for yourself." 
"I saw a heron wading gracefully through the morning mist. Such are the treasures of a quiet life.$k#$e#It's so easy to get caught up in the noise of modern life. Your best years will pass you by in a formless blur. That's why you'v got to learn to slow down. " 
"How have you been, my young friend?" 
"Ah... summer. The warm sun heats up the cans for me.#$b#Then at night I've got a warm meal to look forward to." 
"I have my own reasons for living alone like this.#$e#Some things are best left unsaid...#$e#I should do some foraging." 
"Whenever you catch a fish, take a moment to thank it for its sacrifice.#$b#Even if you don't believe in the spirit of the fish, it's a good mental exercise. We need to be aware of our effect on the environment." 
"You can find rainbow trout in streams right now." 
"This is an easier time of year for me. I don't have to worry about staying warm.#$e#Plus, the fruits of the wild are growing everywhere." 
"I've explored deep into the caves.#$e#They hold some hidden secrets.#$e#Just be cautious if you go in there." 
"Some joker sprayed paint all over my home during the night... It took hours to scrub it off this morning.$k#$e#I need to start gathering lumber for the winter.#$e#Do you have enough lumber to keep your house warm?" 
"I don't have many responsibilities, so I spend my time thinking.#$e#You have to understand your thoughts before you can control them." 
"I don't like to stay in one place for too long." 
"There's nothing quite like a feast of wild mushrooms in the fall.$h" 
"It can get really cold if you live in a tent.$s" 
"Thanks for not shunning me, @. It takes a lot of wisdom to override your base instincts.#$e#I'm a human like everyone else. I just have a different lifestyle." 
"I'm sure you understand why I'm cautious of strangers.#$e#But let's put that in the past, okay? You and I are friends now, I think." 
"Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by.#$e#If you have any animals you should keep them inside." 
"The trees go to sleep during the winter. It makes it a bit lonely out here.#$e#But I wouldn't deny them their beauty sleep.$h" 
"Thanks for stopping by. I was actually feeling a little lonely this morning.#$e#So, have you discovered anything interesting in the mines?" 
"Sleeping on the ground is good for my back.#$e#It's best to look at the positive side of things.$h" 

"These animals never judge people by their looks. The same can't be said for humans."
"Good show, old friend."
"No one really talks to me... I just come for the deviled eggs."
"I'll just slip in a little later and have some food. I'm eyeing that scrumptious looking pie!"
"Oh, hello there. It's nice of you to talk to me.#$b#Spring is almost over... what a shame."
"A slow, continuous rotation is key to achieving the perfect roast."
"I'll just sneak up when the jellies arrive... I don't want to bother anyone."
"I'd join in... but I don't think I'm welcome.$s"
"Igloo-building's an art I picked up from the tundra dwellers who live beyond the frozen sea.#$e#That was many years ago.$h#$e#An Igloo makes a nice home, but it's easier to just stay in my tent year-round."

"...I found you unconscious in the mines. You're lucky I happened to pass by!#$b#Be a little more careful next time, okay?$s"

"Find anything good?$h"

"This is wonderful! You've really made my day special./88 90 234 242 280/This is a great gift. Thank you!/-5 -6 -79 -81/Hmm... This doesn't really do much for me./-2 330/Why would you give this to me? Do you think I like junk just because I live in a tent? That's terrible./2/A gift? How nice./-4/"

"Hello, friend.^The mountain lake has been kind to me lately. I'd like to share my good fortune with you.
"@,^how are you doing? I've enclosed some instructions on how to make one of my favorite fish recipes.
"Hello,^It's blackberry season right now. The bushes are full of them. I want to pick some, but I lost my basket. Can you help?
"@, ^You're lucky I found you last night! You were unconscious, and someone was searching your pockets. I have no idea how much money they took... they ran away as soon as I approached. Be more careful!
"Hi @,^^Thanks for helping me clean up around the valley.^The waters are looking much cleaner. I think everyone will appreciate it. I know I will.^As a way of saying 'thanks', I wanted to teach you how to grow your own fiber. I hope it's useful.

"A warm rain is a pleasant way to get clean.$h"

"Wait!\"
"Hello, Leo... My name's Linus.#$b#I've heard all about you, and your parrot family.#$b#It's really something special!$h\"
"Leo...#$b#I'd like you to come back with us, to Stardew Valley.#$b#It's a beautiful place... not as warm as here, but still full of life... and I live right in the middle of it!#$b#I know the lay of the land, and many things about the waters, the trees, the animals, and more...#$b#You see... I'm a child of nature, too. You might say we're 'birds of a feather'.$h#$b#But, I'm getting old... And I'd like to teach someone all that I've learned before moving on...$s#$b#Leo... will you come back with us?\"
"Well, let's not forget... the choice is really up to Leo...\"
"I understand. This is Leo's home, after all.$s\"
"...It's hard to make changes. But sometimes It's for the best.#$b#Still... the choice is really up to Leo.\"
"Great!\"

"@! Come stand next to the firepit. It feels great.\"
"I was hoping you'd come by sometime.\"
"I wanted to say sorry for mistrusting you at first.$s#$b#Most people don't treat me well, so I've learned to be cautious.$s\"
"But you've been uncommonly nice to me. You're a unique person.$h#$b#...And I consider you a good friend.\"
"Hey, I want to show you something. Come inside.$h\"
"Ah... there we go. See this? It's a special kind of fish bait that I make.#$b#It's top quality stuff... I'd eat it myself!#$b#Here, I want you to have the recipe.\"

"That's very nice of you, but no thanks! I've had great luck foraging today.$h\"
"Er...$s#$b#Um... No, thanks.$s\"
"I appreciate the kindness... I really do...$s#$b#But... I've told you before... I choose to live this way...\"
"I like to be alone most of the time... I like the quiet sounds... moving with the rhythym of nature...#$b#It's a way of life that I'm comfortable with. I don't ever want to change that.\"
"@... I cherish our friendship very much. And I know you do, too.$h#$b#But... You don't need to try and 'help' me... I know best how to live my own life... okay?\"
"...can you smell that? It's the sweet aroma of ripe berries...$h\"
"Thanks, @. You had me worried, there... I thought you were going to ask me to move on to the farm with you! *wink*#$b#You know, I consider you my closest friend in the valley... you've never tried to 'fix' me... you respect my way of life, even if you don't understand it.$h#$b#I really appreciate that.\"

"Ahhh... that feels good.$4\"
"The water's never been cleaner.$4\"
"...And the same goes for me! Hehehe.$5\"

"Not yet...\"

"It was me... I'm sorry.$s\"
"I find a lot of hot, fresh food in these cans... stuff that will go to waste if I don't take it.\"
"$y 'Do you think there's something wrong with what I'm doing?
Disgusting to you, maybe. To me, it's a way of life. And I haven't gotten sick yet. I only eat things that look fresh.
Thanks, @. I knew you were an open-minded person. I feel good about what I'm doing. I'm not harming anyone.
I don't believe in 'private property'. Besides, what do you want me to do? I need this food to survive. Have a heart.
*Sigh*... Not everyone's cut out for this world, @. You don't know what it's like to be me. I'm not harming anyone, I just want to live life in my own way. Is that so wrong?'\"
"You can go on home. I promise I won't rummage in George's can anymore.#$b#You can tell him you scared off the raccoons for good.\"
