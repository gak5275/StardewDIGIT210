"Greetings! I'm Demetrius, local scientist and father. Thanks for introducing yourself!#$e#I'm studying the local plants and animals from my home laboratory.#$b#Have you met my daughter Maru? She's interested to meet you." 
"I already spotted a rare crab. This place is great.$h" 
"I'll be analyzing this data for months." 
"*crunch*... whoops, there goes an endangered crab species...$s#$b#...#$b#Oh, nevermind. It was just the empty shell! I can sleep tonight." 
"Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!" 
"I usually don't partake... but I'm usually not on a tropical island, either. Hahaha.$h" 
"Can you believe this place? It's teeming with exotic life!" 
"It's a good specimen, but a very common species. You can keep it." 
"Fruit and salt? What an odd combination...$s" 
"Robin won't even tell *me* who paid for Pam's new house!#$e#I pretend I'm mad at her but secretly I'm glad she's so loyal to her word...$h" 
"Maru helps me out in the lab sometimes... She's a good kid." 
"It's hard to do good science without Maru's help...#$b#But her happiness is much more important than my experiment!" 
"This valley has a very vibrant and diverse ecosystem. That's one reason I was excited to move here." 
"You're probably growing a lot of interesting plants on your farm, huh?#$e#Maybe I'll stop by your place some day and check it out." 
"How's the farming business going? It's parsnip season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day." 
"Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#Don't tell her I said that.$h" 
"Let's see... If compounds in the rhizosphere contain sufficient levels of Carbon-13, then...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?" 
"It's good to take a break from work every now and then.#$e#I guess that's kind of difficult when you live on a farm, though.#$e#Hey, at least in the winter you don't have to worry about crops." 
"Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u" 
"Hi @! How are you doing today?#$e#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow." 
"Really? I figured a farmer would know the correct answer...$s" 
"See? @ agrees with me." 
"Well, we'd better titrate this solution before it crystallizes on us." 
"*sigh*... $4" 
"Sorry, I'm really busy.#$e#There's so many plants to study right now." 
"Make sure to water your plants every day.#$e#Although, if you're using water retaining soil you don't need to worry about watering as often.#$e#It's pretty convenient." 
"How's the farming business going? It's tomato season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day." 
"$p 40#So I heard Maru had you look through that telescope out back.|If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back.#$e#Pretty exciting, huh?" 
"I hope my daughter's keeping up on her math and science!" 
"Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth?$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?" 
"I became a scientist because I wanted to contribute to the progression of our species.#$e#Of course, none of this would be possible without farmers such as yourself.$h" 
"During this time of year I divert my attentions to fungi." 
"We know a lot about nature thanks to science.#$e#But there's always a lot more to learn." 
"How's the farming business going? It's corn season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day." 
"Maru sure spends a lot of time working on those gadgets of hers.#$e#I'm glad she's so dedicated." 
"I'm still flabbergasted about Maru's secret robot... was it all a dream?" 
"Let's see... perhaps the nitrogen fixation level is affected by nematode secretions...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?" 
"Hi @. I'm always glad when you come for a visit.#$e#It's nice to have some company after all this lonely lab-work." 
"I'm taking a break from my research right now." 
"Talk to my wife if you want to increase the size of your house." 
"Do you have a kitchen in your house yet?#$e#Cooking is kind of like doing lab work." 
"Do you have any animals on your farm?" 
"Hello.
"Let's see... if seasonal nitrogen levels could be modeled by a piecewise function...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was analyzing data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?" 
"Feel free to harvest as much lumber and stone from this area as you please." 
"Thanks for stopping by. I need to think about something other than legumes for a while.#$e#So, what have you been doing lately?#$e#That sounds interesting." 

"Robin really works hard on her carpentry stuff... she deserves a little recognition now and then."
"I haven't seen Maru in hours... I hope she's alright."
"Egg... what a strange thing to eat."
"Hey @, did you get a taste of my carp roe pie?#$b#...What? It is the 'egg' festival, isn't it?"
"These springtime dances can be traced back to ancient fertility rituals.#$e#Hey... You should know about this stuff, farmer."
"This is tiring, honey. Are you ready to visit the buffet soon? *pant*"
"The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south.#$e#It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious."
"I'll probably get another tool set this year... *sigh*"
"You know what? I probably should've worn a jacket."

"You're giving this to me? This is amazing!/207 232 233 400/Thank you! This is a very interesting specimen./-5 -79 422/...What is this?/80 330/This is disgusting./2/That was very thoughtful of you./-4/"
"Dear @,^I was conducting a field study the other day, and I found this specimen. ^I hope you find it as interesting as I did.
"I wanted to say 'thanks' for taking an interest in my work. Here's a cooking recipe that I like.
"Dear @,^Tonight at around 10 o'clock PM, a rare and beautiful event will take place.^^The moonlight jellies will be passing by Pelican Town on their long journey south for the winter.^^We're all gathering at the beach to watch. You don't want to miss this!^See you tonight,
"@-^I'm gathering data on the correlation between soil alkalinity and crop fructose levels. Long story short, I need a fresh melon from your farm. If you brought me one I'd be very grateful.
1000g
"Hi @,^^Thanks for your help with the fish.^Nature is usually good at keeping things balanced, but sometimes artificial factors can cause an imbalance.^^I've enclosed a blueprint from a science magazine that you might find interesting.
"Greetings. Stay inside if you want to keep warm."

"Hi @! I have some good news for you. A few days ago I made a breakthrough in my research on the local environment.$h#$b#I'll spare you the technical details and get to the point... You know that empty cave over there, a little ways to the west? Well, I have a way to turn it into something useful... for both of us.#$b#I'd like to set up the cave to attract some local species. That way I can observe them in a more controlled environment. And you can harvest whatever products they produce.#$b#I can either set up the cave to attract mushrooms or fruit bats. The bats will sometimes leave fruit for you to collect.\"
"Alright! I'll go set it up for you right now! It shouldn't take any time at all.$h#$b#Thanks for letting me do this.\"
"I'm excited to see what happens with that cave. Aren't you?#$e#I hope you're pleased with the work I did.\"

"Thanks for helping out, @.\"
"Maru's a good kid. She's my special little girl...\"
"I wouldn't want anything getting in the way of her bright future, know what I mean?$5\"
"Just some food for thought... *chuckle*$h\"
"...I was just telling @ about the soil samples we're testing.\"
Right, @?
"Okay, okay... we were talking about you, sweetie.$5#$b#I wanted to say a few things to @ about you... but I didn't want to embarrass you. I shouldn't have lied about it.$s\"

"I don't understand. Tomatoes are fruits!\"
"@! I'm glad you're here. You'll be able to put this argument to rest.\"
How would you classify a tomato?
"I just want you to understand my point of view.#$b#It's hard for me to know exactly what assumptions I should make when you tell me something.\"
"But I'll try to get better at it.\"
"Thanks for your help, @.$h\"

"Ah Ha! I knew it!$4\"
"Agh! What is it?!$6\"
"Sweet Yoba... it talks!$6\"
"This is why you've locked yourself in your room the last few months?$5\"
"...and I thought you were down here fooling around with @...$s\"
"It's okay, Maru. Let MarILDA go free.$5#$b#Your mother and I can take care of ourselves. I know you're ready to start a life of your own, and I've come to terms with the thought of not having you around anymore.#$b#Besides, this... creation of yours seems pretty advanced. It wouldn't feel right to keep her as a servant.\"
"@, I'm sorry I mistrusted you. You're a good guy.$5^@, I'm sorry I mistrusted you. You're a fine young woman.$5#$b#I've never seen Maru so lively and creative... and I've never been more proud of her. If you've had a hand in that, then you have my gratitude.\"

"Um... Robin? What's the point of the four posts? It seems like an inefficient use of materials.$s\"
"Hmm, I see your point.. But we can't let that outweigh the utility and efficiency of the sleep receptacle.\"
"*ahem*... Well... If anyone needs me, I'll be in the doghouse...$5\"
"Great minds think alike...$h\"

"I love your art, Leah! 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace' is my favorite.$h\"
"I'm in.\"
