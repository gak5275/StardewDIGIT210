"Hey, it's Mr. @, the new farmer! I'm Pierre, owner of the local general store.^Hey, it's Ms. @, the new farmer! I'm Pierre, owner of the local general store.#$b#If you're looking for seeds, my shop is the place to go. I'll also buy produce from you for a good price!#$e#A little agriculture could really inject new life into the local economy!" 
"I'm losing a lot of money being away from the shop...$s#$b#But, you know what? It's worth it." 
"Mmm... that salty smell of the sea is making me want some sashimi." 
"Eh, let the kids play in the sun. I'll just sit in this chair." 
"Drink after drink... Gus must be making a killing!" 
"This is a dream-come-true! You can't begin to imagine how much stress JojaMart was causing me.#$e#For a small town like this, one store is enough! There's too much social pressure for me to overcharge, anyway." 
"This is a sad day for Pelican Town... The stronger Joja becomes, the closer I move toward bankruptcy. I might have to sell the shop soon...$s" 
"Hey, that's a great idea... It'll be nice to get out from behind the counter. I'll meet you there!" 
"Welcome! If you're looking for seeds, you've come to the right place!" 
"Hello, er... my son?$s^Hello, er... daughter?$s" 
"Hi, @. Need any seeds or fruit tree saplings?" 
"Hi, @. How's Abigail doing? The shop hasn't been the same without her..." 
"Sometimes I get new items in stock, so make sure to stop by every so often.#$e#It's a lot of work to run a shop.$h" 
"You know, I used to be a pretty good boxer back in the day... my right hook was the stuff of legend!$h" 
"It's my day off today.#$e#Hmmm... what to do...$s" 
"When I was younger I always had something interesting to do... now I find myself just wasting time whenever I'm not at work.$s" 
"I'm happy to buy any produce off you.#$b#I'll give you a fair price, of course!" 
"I really do appreciate your business, Mr. @. I've been having a harder and harder time turning a decent profit.^I really do appreciate your business, Ms. @. I've been having a harder and harder time turning a decent profit." 
"Does Abigail look anything like me? Don't tell my wife, but sometimes I wonder if I'm really the father.$k$s#$e#Don't tell my wife, but I hate to cook dinner." 
"Business has been slow since Joja moved into town. It's hard to compete with their selection.$k$s#$e#Hi there. Is your farm doing well?#$e#Maybe a few of my seeds will spruce things up." 
"If you find any wild produce, I'll take it off your hands for a reasonable price." 
"I'll tell you a secret. Sometimes, when the store is empty, I'll practice my opera singing behind the counter.$h#$e#Don't tell anyone." 
"*sigh*... I've got those behind-the-counter blues...$k$s#$e#I wish I could go for a walk, but I can't leave the store unattended.#$e#I've heard the flowers are in bloom and the air smells great...$s" 
"*sigh*... No matter how well the business does, it's never enough to satisfy my desire for success. What's wrong with me? Maybe I'm just bored with domestic life.$s#$e#Some day I'm going to open a new shop in the city and make a killing.#$e#Unfortunately, business is so slow I can hardly save any money...$s" 
"Hey, @. You're my number one customer!" 
"I've got summer seeds available! You'd better stock up." 
"I'm so glad to have a day off from work." 
"Everyone's enjoying the weather instead of shopping... *sigh*" 
"Oh, hi. Are you satisfied with the quality of my summer seeds?" 
"Summer is a good time to eat a refreshing salad, don't you think?" 
"Ugh... It's so hot in here." 
"You can't grow any crops during winter... so I have no seeds to offer you.#$e#It's really going to cut into our profits." 
"I'm going to surprise Caroline tonight with dinner and a bottle of Stardew Red. Don't tell anyone!$k#$e#Finally, a day of relaxation." 
"Hi. In the mood for a litle shopping?" 
"I mainly deal in edibles, so if you've got any ores or wood you'd better try selling them somewhere else." 
"Is it just me or is there a cold draft in here?" 
"If I didn't have this shop to run I would be outside right now.#$e#It would be fun to throw a snowball." 
"Fall seeds are here! Crops don't grow in winter so this is your last shot until spring.#$b#Better go all out, huh?" 
"It's starting to get cold outside...#$b#That means more people come into the shop to warm up... hehe." 
"My dream is to keep opening new stores until I become extremely wealthy. hehehe.$k#$e#Hi there. Is your farm still doing well?#$e#Maybe a few of my seeds will spruce things up.$h" 
"I'm happy to buy whatever you produce on the farm.#$e#Yes, I do resell it for a profit... but that's the benefit of being an established shop owner.#$e#Don't get any ideas..." 
"If I didn't have this shop to run I would be outside right now...#$e#The leaves look great and the mushrooms are sprouting." 
"Thanks, I appreciate that. Just forget you ever saw this, okay?$h#$b#...And I'll just forget that you were snooping around in my bedroom!" 
"You would really do that to me? You're terrible.$s#$b#You shouldn't have been snooping around in my bedroom in the first place! Nosy neighbors are the worst.$3" 

"My store carries the very finest quality products in the whole valley. Please, inspect my grange display closely and see for yourself!"
"Hey! How'd you get back here?$u#$b#Don't touch anything."
"Trying to make a back-room deal, huh? Hah! I admire your gumption."
"What! How'd you get back here?$u#$b#Don't touch anything."
"Hmm... maybe if I get on the governor's good side he'll give my business a tax break...#$b#I wonder if he likes aged whiskey?#$e#Now if only the Mayor would stop shmoozing with him all afternoon."
"Psst... Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds!"
"My sales figures have been phenomenal lately... thanks to the Feast of the Winter Star!$h#$e#Boy, holidays are good for business. I wonder if I could invent some new ones..."
"This snow is so cold I can't feel my fingers anymore...$s"

"Hey, remember that {2} you sold me the other day? I ended up serving it to the family for a special dinner.#$b#I can't say it was a hit... $s#$b#... well,... back to business, huh?"
"Hey, remember that {2} you sold me the other day? I ended up serving it to the family for a special dinner.#$b#My wife loved it! ...And Abby even started going to town on it after I smothered the thing in hoisin sauce. $h#$b#... well,... back to business, huh?"

"Dear @,^I am now selling higher quality fertilizers, as well as new crop selections! See you soon.
Pierre here... I really, really want a plate of sashimi. I'll pay top coin to whoever brings me some.
"Dear @,^^I guess people didn't take to 'Pierre's Prime Produce' like I'd hoped...^^Anyways, here's my old 'Mini-Shipping Bin'.^The next time you get your hands on some produce worthy of the 'Pierre's Prime' luxury brand, maybe you could have them shipped my way?

"Most people stay indoors on days like this... It's not good for business.$s"

"No... Not this time, Morris.$u#$b#I think it's time we settled this once and for all.$u\"
"If you're too scared to fight me then bring one of your co-workers! Or are all Joja employees such cowards?$u\"
"And the way you throw punches is just like Joja...$u#$b#Quantity over quality!\"

"ONLY... *mumble* mumble*\"
"Heh... that's right. It really is a bargain, isn't it?\"
"Wait! How about 10,000g then!?$4\"
"It's a disaster, @... $s#$b#I thought this was a surefire business strategy.$s#$b#But it turns out, no one is willing to buy vegetables at a 10x price markup, even if I put the little 'organic' sticker on them.$s\"
"You're right, you can't run a business without taking some risk.\"
"Hey, I'm not forcing anyone to buy it! If they don't like the price, they can move on.$3\"
"...But, I guess you have a point. If I make all my customers angry, then pretty soon I won't have any customers at all...$s\"
"By the way, @... you look like you could really use a veggie dinner tonight.#$b#What do you say, wanna buy these back for the low, low price of 2,501g?\"
