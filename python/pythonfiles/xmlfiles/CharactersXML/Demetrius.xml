<p><context>Introduction:</context> <dialogue>"Greetings! I'm Demetrius, local scientist and father. Thanks for introducing yourself!#$e#I'm studying the local plants and animals from my home laboratory.#$b#Have you met my daughter Maru? She's interested to meet you."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Entering:</context> <dialogue>"I already spotted a rare crab. This place is great.$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Leaving:</context> <dialogue>"I'll be analyzing this data for months."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Shore:</context> <dialogue>"*crunch*... whoops, there goes an endangered crab species...$s#$b#...#$b#Oh, nevermind. It was just the empty shell! I can sleep tonight."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Chair:</context> <dialogue>"Are you having fun, @? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort_Bar:</context> <dialogue>"I usually don't partake... but I'm usually not on a tropical island, either. Hahaha.$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Resort:</context> <dialogue>"Can you believe this place? It's teeming with exotic life!"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>reject_869:</context> <dialogue>"It's a good specimen, but a very common species. You can keep it."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>reject_865:</context> <dialogue>"Fruit and salt? What an odd combination...$s"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>pamHouseUpgradeAnonymous:</context> <dialogue>"Robin won't even tell *me* who paid for Pam's new house!#$e#I pretend I'm mad at her but secretly I'm glad she's so loyal to her word...$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Mon:</context> <dialogue>"Maru helps me out in the lab sometimes... She's a good kid."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Mon_inlaw_Maru:</context> <dialogue>"It's hard to do good science without Maru's help...#$b#But her happiness is much more important than my experiment!"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Tue:</context> <dialogue>"This valley has a very vibrant and diverse ecosystem. That's one reason I was excited to move here."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed:</context> <dialogue>"You're probably growing a lot of interesting plants on your farm, huh?#$e#Maybe I'll stop by your place some day and check it out."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Thu:</context> <dialogue>"How's the farming business going? It's parsnip season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri:</context> <dialogue>"Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#Don't tell her I said that.$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sat:</context> <dialogue>"Let's see... If compounds in the rhizosphere contain sufficient levels of Carbon-13, then...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Sun:</context> <dialogue>"It's good to take a break from work every now and then.#$e#I guess that's kind of difficult when you live on a farm, though.#$e#Hey, at least in the winter you don't have to worry about crops."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Fri4:</context> <dialogue>"Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$e#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Wed6:</context> <dialogue>"Hi @! How are you doing today?#$e#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Event_tomato1:</context> <dialogue>"Really? I figured a farmer would know the correct answer...$s"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Event_tomato2:</context> <dialogue>"See? @ agrees with me."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Event_Lab_Silence:</context> <dialogue>"Well, we'd better titrate this solution before it crystallizes on us."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>Event_Lab_Rat:</context> <dialogue>"*sigh*... %fork$4"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Mon:</context> <dialogue>"#$e#%Demetrius is deep in thought.#$e#Sorry, I'm really busy.#$e#There's so many plants to study right now."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Tue:</context> <dialogue>"Make sure to water your plants every day.#$e#Although, if you're using water retaining soil you don't need to worry about watering as often.#$e#It's pretty convenient."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Thu:</context> <dialogue>"How's the farming business going? It's tomato season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Fri:</context> <dialogue>"$p 40#So I heard Maru had you look through that telescope out back.|If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back.#$e#Pretty exciting, huh?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Fri_inlaw_Maru:</context> <dialogue>"I hope my daughter's keeping up on her math and science!"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Sat:</context> <dialogue>"Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth?$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>summer_Mon6:</context> <dialogue>"I became a scientist because I wanted to contribute to the progression of our species.#$e#Of course, none of this would be possible without farmers such as yourself.$h"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Mon:</context> <dialogue>"During this time of year I divert my attentions to fungi."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Tue:</context> <dialogue>"We know a lot about nature thanks to science.#$e#But there's always a lot more to learn."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Thu:</context> <dialogue>"How's the farming business going? It's corn season, isn't it?#$e#I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Fri:</context> <dialogue>"Maru sure spends a lot of time working on those gadgets of hers.#$e#I'm glad she's so dedicated."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Fri_inlaw_Maru:</context> <dialogue>"I'm still flabbergasted about Maru's secret robot... was it all a dream?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Sat:</context> <dialogue>"Let's see... perhaps the nitrogen fixation level is affected by nematode secretions...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>fall_Wed6:</context> <dialogue>"Hi @. I'm always glad when you come for a visit.#$e#It's nice to have some company after all this lonely lab-work."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Mon:</context> <dialogue>"I'm taking a break from my research right now."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Tue:</context> <dialogue>"Talk to my wife if you want to increase the size of your house."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Wed:</context> <dialogue>"Do you have a kitchen in your house yet?#$e#Cooking is kind of like doing lab work."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Thu:</context> <dialogue>"Do you have any animals on your farm?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Fri:</context> <dialogue>"Hello.#$e#%Demetrius seems lost in thought."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Sat:</context> <dialogue>"Let's see... if seasonal nitrogen levels could be modeled by a piecewise function...$u#$b#Oh! Sorry. I was analyzing data and I didn't notice you there.#$e#Do you need anything?"</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Sun:</context> <dialogue>"Feel free to harvest as much lumber and stone from this area as you please."</dialogue> </p>
<p><context>winter_Fri4:</context> <dialogue>"Thanks for stopping by. I need to think about something other than legumes for a while.#$e#So, what have you been doing lately?#$e#That sounds interesting."</dialogue> </p>
